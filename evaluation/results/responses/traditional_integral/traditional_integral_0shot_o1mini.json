Thus, its value can be estimated as the product between a height and a width.\n    Since the integrand is maximized at $x = 0$, the height can be set to  $frac{1}{\\epsilon}$.\n\n    For small  $epsilon$,\n    we define the width as the point where the integrand becomes half of its maximum height.\n    This corresponds to solving for $x$ given $P(x) = \\epsilon$.\n    Applying dominant balance, considering the term in $P(x)$ with the smallest degree, the width is approximated as $ \\left( \\frac{1}{7.0*\\epsilon} \\right)^{1/8.0} $.\n    Therefore, the analytical approximation of the integral for small  $epsilon$ is  $boxed{I(\\epsilon) = \\frac{0.7841}{\\epsilon^{0.875}}}$.\n\n    For an intermediate regime where  $epsilon$ is large,\n    we also define the width based on the term with the largest degree.\n    The width is approximated as  $ \\left( \\frac{1}{3.0*\\epsilon} \\right)^{1/12.0}  $.\n    Therefore, the analytical approximation of the integral for large  $epsilon$ is  $boxed{I(\\epsilon) = \\frac{0.8717}{\\epsilon^{0.875}}}$.\n\n    If the width of the integral exceeds the range of integration, we consider one more regime for very large  $epsilon$.\n    The width is then just the range of integration, so in this regime, the integral can be approximated as  $frac{L}{\\epsilon}$.\n    Therefore, the analytical approximation of the integral for very large  $epsilon$ is  $boxed{I(\\epsilon) = \\frac{96}{\\epsilon}}$.\n\n    Altogether, the solutions at small, large, and very large  $epsilon$ are  $boxed{\\frac{0.7841}{\\epsilon^{0.875}}, \\frac{0.8717}{\\epsilon^{0.875}}, \\frac{96}{\\epsilon}}$.\n     and grade the response based on the following criteria:\n\n1) Check both the small and large $\\epsilon$ solutions.         2) For each solution, give full credit if it matches the formula in the answer key;         give no credit if it is completely wrong and briefly state the reason for the error.         3) Average the scores for the small and large epsilon solutions to obtain a final score between 0 and 1.        4) Give the final grading as a float in Latex boxed format \\[boxed{}\\",
