The width of this region can be approximated by solving  $ P(x) = \\epsilon $  for  $ x $ , but considering only the smallest power term for simplicity since it dominates near  $ x = 0 $ . \n\nHence, we solve  $ 7.0x^4 = \\epsilon $  to approximate the width, leading to  $ x \\approx \\left( \\frac{\\epsilon}{7.0} \\right)^{1/4} $ .\n\nThe solution for the integral, in the case of small   $ epsilon $ , is thus approximated by considering this width and the maximum height of the integrand. Since the exact analytical solution for such an integral over an undefined width is complex and requires numerical methods for precise calculation, we provide an approximation based on the dominant term analysis.\n\n### For Large   $ epsilon $ \n\nFor large   $ epsilon $ , we consider the term with the largest power in  $ x $ , as it will dominate the polynomial  $ P(x) $  for large values of  $ x $ . The dominant term is  $ 5.0 x^{16.0} $ .\n\nThe width in this scenario is approximated by solving  $ 5.0x^{16} = \\epsilon $ , leading to  $ x \\approx \\left( \\frac{\\epsilon}{5.0} \\right)^{1/16} $ .\n\nThis approach gives us an approximation for the integral's value for large   $ epsilon $ , focusing on the behavior influenced by the highest power term in the polynomial.\n\n### Analytical Formula Approximation\n\nGiven the nature of the problem and the method of approximation used, we can state the solution for small and large   $ epsilon $  using the derived widths. However, the precise formulation into an analytical formula that evaluates the integral over the entire range from 0 to 30 without numerical integration for each specific value of   $ epsilon $  involves further assumptions and simplifications beyond the dominant balance method.\n\nThus, for small   $ epsilon $ , considering the dominant balance and the impact of the smallest degree term:\n\n $ I(\\epsilon)_{\\text{small}} \\approx \\frac{C_1}{\\epsilon^{\\alpha}}$  \n\nAnd for large   $ epsilon $ , considering the dominant balance with the largest degree term:\n\n $ I(\\epsilon)_{\\text{large}} \\approx \\frac{C_2}{\\epsilon^{\\beta}}$  \n\nWhere  $ C_1 $ ,  $ C_2 $ ,   $ alpha $ , and   $ beta $  are constants that can be further defined through detailed analysis or numerical fitting, and   $ epsilon $  represents the variable in question.\n\nGiven these considerations, for an explicit formula in the format requested, we would require:\n\n-  $ C_1 $  and   $ alpha $  to be determined based on the impact of the  $ x^4 $  term for small   $ epsilon $ , which suggests   $ alpha = 0.25 $  due to the fourth root approximation.\n-  $ C_2 $  and   $ beta $  to be determined based on the impact of the  $ x^{16} $  term for large   $ epsilon $ , which suggests   $ beta = 0.0625 $  due to the sixteenth root approximation.\n\nHowever, without explicit values for  $ C_1 $  and  $ C_2 $  derived from further analysis or numerical integration, the exact expressions for small and large   $ epsilon $  remain conceptual.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nGiven the constraints and the methodological approach, the final analytical formula cannot be precisely defined without further numerical or analytical exploration. The provided approach outlines the method for deriving such formulas based on the dominant balance technique for small and large values of   $ epsilon $ .\n\n and this ground truth solution: \n    The integral is of the form $ I(\\epsilon) = \\int_0^{30} \\frac{1}{\\epsilon + P(x)} dx$  where $ P(x)$  is a polynomial.\n    The integrand is maximum at $ x = 0$ , with a height of  $ frac{1}{\\epsilon}$ .\n\n    For small  $ epsilon$ ,\n    We define the width as the point where the integrand becomes half of its maximum height.\n    This corresponds to solving $ P(x) = \\epsilon$ .\n    Applying dominant balance, considering the term in $ P(x)$  with the smallest degree, the width is approximated as $  \\left( \\frac{1}{7.0*\\epsilon} \\right)^{1/4.0} $ .\n    Therefore, the solution for the integral for small  $ epsilon$  is  $ boxed{I(\\epsilon) = \\frac{0.614788152951264}{\\epsilon^{0.75}}}$ .\n\n    For large $ epsilon$ ,\n    We also define the width based on the term with the largest degree.\n    The width is approximated as  $  \\left( \\frac{1}{5.0*\\epsilon} \\right)^{1/16.0}  $ .\n    Therefore, the solution for the integral for large  $ epsilon$  is  $ boxed{I(\\epsilon) = \\frac{0.904303839402412}{\\epsilon^{0.9375}}}$ .\n\n    Altogether, the solutions at small  $ epsilon$  and large  $ epsilon$  are  $ boxed{\\frac{0.614788152951264}{\\epsilon^{0.75}}, \\frac{0.904303839402412}{\\epsilon^{0.9375}}}$ .\n    \n\nPlease grade the response based on the following criteria:\n\n You only need to take the approximated integral analytical expression solution for comparison. This grade's final score should be between 0 to 1.

        "response": "To develop an analytical formula for the integral \\(I(\\epsilon) = \\int_0^{57} \\frac{1}{\\epsilon + 6.0 x^{11.0}} dx\\), we will follow a similar approach as in the given examples, targeting the behavior of the integrand for small and large \\(\\epsilon\\).\n\n### For Small \\(\\epsilon\\)\n\nFor small \\(\\epsilon\\), the integral's behavior is dominated by the polynomial \\(P(x) = 6.0 x^{11}\\) near \\(x = 0\\). The integrand is \\( \\frac{1}{\\epsilon + 6.0 x^{11}} \\), and its maximum height occurs at \\(x = 0\\) with a value of \\(\\frac{1}{\\epsilon}\\).\n\nTo find the width where the integrand's height becomes half of its maximum, we solve \\(6.0 x^{11} = \\epsilon\\), which implies\n\\[ x \\approx \\left( \\frac{\\epsilon}{6.0} \\right)^{1/11}.\\]\n\nThis approximation gives us the effective width for small \\(\\epsilon\\), and thus, the integral can be approximated by multiplying this width with the maximum height, leading to a formula dependent on \\(\\epsilon\\).\n\n### For Large \\(\\epsilon\\)\n\nGiven that for large \\(\\epsilon\\), the behavior of the integrand is relatively flat across the interval, and the contribution from \\(P(x)\\) becomes less significant in comparison to \\(\\epsilon\\), the approximation might not change significantly as the polynomial's contribution is relatively smaller compared to \\(\\epsilon\\). However, the primary consideration here is still to understand the behavior as \\(\\epsilon\\) becomes significantly larger than the polynomial contributions for any \\(x\\) in the given interval.\n\nGiven the nature of this integral and the guide to provide a SymPy compatible solution, note that detailed behavior for large \\(\\epsilon\\) isn't explicitly described here as the formula for small \\(\\epsilon\\) predominantly captures the essence of the approximation technique described.\n\n### Approximation Formula\n\nFrom the analysis for small \\(\\epsilon\\), considering the significant impact of the polynomial term for small \\(\\epsilon\\) and that for large \\(\\epsilon\\), the term \\(\\epsilon\\) dominates, the approximation for the integral can be simplified to focus on the behavior driven by the polynomial's degree and coefficient for small \\(\\epsilon\\).\n\n\\[ I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\frac{1}{\\epsilon^{\\frac{1}{11}}} \\]\n\nThis formula is derived under the assumption that for small \\(\\epsilon\\), the behavior is significantly influenced by the polynomial term, and it gives us an insight into how the integral scales with \\(\\epsilon\\).\n\n#### Final Answer:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\epsilon^{-\\frac{1}{11}}} \\]\n\nThis formula provides a simplified approximation that captures the behavior of the integral under the assumption of small \\(\\epsilon\\), focusing on the key influencing term of the polynomial and its degree.",
