Therefore, the response is completely wrong for small \\(\\epsilon\\).\n\n**Score for small \\(\\epsilon\\):** 0\n\n### Large \\(\\epsilon\\) Solution\n- **Response:** \\(\\frac{1}{\\left(\\frac{1}{3.0}\\right)^{1/12.0} + \\epsilon}\\)\n- **Ground Truth:** \\(\\frac{0.8717}{\\epsilon^{0.875}}\\)\n\nSimilarly, the response does not match the ground truth. The ground truth involves a power of \\(\\epsilon\\) in the denominator, while the response has a different form. Therefore, the response is completely wrong for large \\(\\epsilon\\).\n\n**Score for large \\(\\epsilon\\):** 0\n\n### Final Score Calculation\nThe average of the scores for small and large \\(\\epsilon\\) is:\n\\[\n\\frac{0 + 0}{2} = 0\n\\]\n\n### Final Grading\n\\[\n\\boxed{0}\n\\]",
