But without solving the integral directly, specifying such a formula directly in terms of   $ epsilon $  without further assumptions or simplifications would be speculative and not accurate.\n\nFor a true analytical approach to solving or approximating this integral, one would typically resort to numerical methods or further approximation methods tailored to the specific behavior of the function over the integral's domain. \n\nTherefore, while the desired analytical formula in simple terms as requested cannot be accurately provided without further simplifications or assumptions that are not justifiable within the scope of this analysis, the discussion highlights the challenges and considerations in approximating integrals of complex functions.\n\n and this ground truth solution: \n    The integral is of the form $ I(\\epsilon) = \\int_0^{47} \\frac{1}{\\epsilon + P(x)} dx$  where $ P(x)$  is a polynomial.\n    The integrand is maximum at $ x = 0$ , with a height of  $ frac{1}{\\epsilon}$ .\n\n    For small  $ epsilon$ ,\n    We define the width as the point where the integrand becomes half of its maximum height.\n    This corresponds to solving $ P(x) = \\epsilon$ .\n    Applying dominant balance, considering the term in $ P(x)$  with the smallest degree, the width is approximated as $  \\left( \\frac{1}{7.0*\\epsilon} \\right)^{1/4.0} $ .\n    Therefore, the solution for the integral for small  $ epsilon$  is  $ boxed{I(\\epsilon) = \\frac{0.614788152951264}{\\epsilon^{0.75}}}$ .\n\n    For large $ epsilon$ ,\n    We also define the width based on the term with the largest degree.\n    The width is approximated as  $  \\left( \\frac{1}{4.0*\\epsilon} \\right)^{1/18.0}  $ .\n    Therefore, the solution for the integral for large  $ epsilon$  is  $ boxed{I(\\epsilon) = \\frac{0.92587471228729}{\\epsilon^{0.944444444444444}}}$ .\n\n    Altogether, the solutions at small  $ epsilon$  and large  $ epsilon$  are  $ boxed{\\frac{0.614788152951264}{\\epsilon^{0.75}}, \\frac{0.92587471228729}{\\epsilon^{0.944444444444444}}}$ .\n    \n\nPlease grade the response based on the following criteria:\n\n You only need to take the approximated integral analytical expression solution for comparison.

For   $ epsilon $  small, the contribution near  $ 0 $  might be significant due to the   $ epsilon $  term preventing divergence.\n\nGiven the complexity of obtaining a precise analytical solution across the entire domain, and my initial approach's oversight regarding the behavior at  $ x=0 $ , a more accurate method would involve considering the exact form and potentially using numerical methods for specific   $ epsilon $  values or employing more sophisticated approximation techniques that account for both the   $ epsilon $  influence and the high power of  $ x $ .\n\nTherefore, an exact analytical formula solely in terms of   $ epsilon $ , without additional approximations or conditions, cannot be straightforwardly provided based on the initial simplification path I explored.\n\nFor an exact, generally applicable analytical solution, one would typically need to revert to numerical integration methods for specific values of   $ epsilon $ , as the integral does not lend itself to a simple, closed-form expression due to the interplay between   $ epsilon $  and  $ x^{14} $  across the full range of integration.\n\n and this ground truth solution: \n    The integral is of the form $ I(\\epsilon) = \\int_0^{41} \\frac{1}{\\epsilon + P(x)} dx$  where $ P(x)$  is a polynomial.\n    The integrand is maximum at $ x = 0$ , with a height of  $ frac{1}{\\epsilon}$ .\n\n    For small  $ epsilon$ ,\n    We define the width as the point where the integrand becomes half of its maximum height.\n    This corresponds to solving $ P(x) = \\epsilon$ .\n    Applying dominant balance, considering the term in $ P(x)$  with the smallest degree, the width is approximated as $  \\left( \\frac{1}{5.0*\\epsilon} \\right)^{1/14.0} $ .\n    Therefore, the solution for the integral for small  $ epsilon$  is  $ boxed{I(\\epsilon) = \\frac{0.891401932184271}{\\epsilon^{0.928571428571429}}}$ .\n\n    For large $ epsilon$ ,\n    We also define the width based on the term with the largest degree.\n    The width is approximated as  $  \\left( \\frac{1}{5.0*\\epsilon} \\right)^{1/14.0}  $ .\n    Therefore, the solution for the integral for large  $ epsilon$  is  $ boxed{I(\\epsilon) = \\frac{0.891401932184271}{\\epsilon^{0.928571428571429}}}$ .\n\n    Altogether, the solutions at small  $ epsilon$  and large  $ epsilon$  are  $ boxed{\\frac{0.891401932184271}{\\epsilon^{0.928571428571429}}, \\frac{0.891401932184271}{\\epsilon^{0.928571428571429}}}$ .\n    \n\nPlease grade the response based on the following criteria:\n\n You only need to take the approximated integral analytical expression solution for comparison.

However, for the sake of providing an approximate formula, let's consider further simplification or approximation based on the nature of   $ epsilon $ .\n\n### Small   $ epsilon $  Assumption\nIf we assume   $ epsilon $  is relatively small compared to the magnitude of  $ 4.0 x^{16} $  over the interval of integration, the   $ epsilon $  term could be considered as a minor adjustment to the behavior of the denominator, mainly affecting the integral's value near the lower limit of integration. \n\nYet, even with this assumption, directly integrating   $ frac{1}{\\epsilon + 4.0 x^{16}} $  analytically across the given domain without resorting to numerical methods or specific special functions isn't straightforward due to the complexity of the integrand.\n\n### Conclusion and Final Answer\nGiven the constraints and the goal of providing an analytical formula, without specific methods (like series expansion, special functions, or further approximations which simplify the expression to a form integrable in elementary functions), we can't derive a simple, closed-form expression for  $ I(\\epsilon) $  from the provided setup.\n\nFor practical purposes and in real-world scenarios, this integral would be evaluated numerically, especially considering the presence of   $ epsilon $  and the high power of  $ x $  in the denominator. \n\nHence, without further simplification or assumptions that allow for a straightforward analytical integration, the solution path outlined is more conceptual than final. \n\nFor a specific analytical formula in the context as initially requested, without employing deeper approximations or numerical methods, we're unable to provide a simple SymPy convertible formula or an explicit expression for the boxed format as desired.\n\n and this ground truth solution: \n    The integral is of the form $ I(\\epsilon) = \\int_0^{29} \\frac{1}{\\epsilon + P(x)} dx$  where $ P(x)$  is a polynomial.\n    The integrand is maximum at $ x = 0$ , with a height of  $ frac{1}{\\epsilon}$ .\n\n    For small  $ epsilon$ ,\n    We define the width as the point where the integrand becomes half of its maximum height.\n    This corresponds to solving $ P(x) = \\epsilon$ .\n    Applying dominant balance, considering the term in $ P(x)$  with the smallest degree, the width is approximated as $  \\left( \\frac{1}{1.0*\\epsilon} \\right)^{1/7.0} $ .\n    Therefore, the solution for the integral for small  $ epsilon$  is  $ boxed{I(\\epsilon) = \\frac{1.0}{\\epsilon^{0.857142857142857}}}$ .\n\n    For large $ epsilon$ ,\n    We also define the width based on the term with the largest degree.\n    The width is approximated as  $  \\left( \\frac{1}{4.0*\\epsilon} \\right)^{1/16.0}  $ .\n    Therefore, the solution for the integral for large  $ epsilon$  is  $ boxed{I(\\epsilon) = \\frac{0.917004043204671}{\\epsilon^{0.9375}}}$ .\n\n    Altogether, the solutions at small  $ epsilon$  and large  $ epsilon$  are  $ boxed{\\frac{1.0}{\\epsilon^{0.857142857142857}}, \\frac{0.917004043204671}{\\epsilon^{0.9375}}}$ .\n    \n\nPlease grade the response based on the following criteria:\n\n You only need to take the approximated integral analytical expression solution for comparison.

Thus, the integral simplifies to:\n\n $ I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\int_0^{10.00} \\frac{1}{8.0 x^{13.0} + 5.0 x^{17.0}} dx$  \n\nFurther simplifying and focusing on the dominant  $ x^{17} $  term,\n\n $ I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\int_0^{10.00} \\frac{1}{5.0 x^{17.0}} dx$  \n\n $ I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\frac{1}{5.0} \\int_0^{10.00} x^{-17.0} dx$  \n\n $ I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\frac{1}{5.0} \\left[ \\frac{x^{-16.0}}{-16.0} \\right]_0^{10.00}$  \n\nWhen evaluating this from 0 to 10, we must handle the singularity at  $ x=0 $ . This singularity suggests that our approximation may not directly apply at  $ x=0 $ , but the integral's main contribution comes from values of  $ x $  near 0 given the rapid decay of  $ x^{-17} $ . For physical and practical purposes, we can consider evaluating this near 0 but focusing on the behavior as  $ x \\to 10 $ , where the function is well-behaved. Recognizing the limits of our approximation near  $ x=0 $ , we're focusing instead on capturing the general behavior of the integral across the majority of the interval where  $ x^{17} $  dominates. For  $ x $  very close to 0, the actual behavior would need a more refined analysis ignoring this singularity due to our initial approximations which focused on the dominance of higher power terms and essentially neglected   $ epsilon $  and lower power terms for  $ x > 0 $ . \n\nGiven this simplification and for the purpose of providing an analytical expression that captures the essence of the dominant balance approach we've utilized, without implying it correctly handles the singularity at  $ x=0 $ :\n\n $ I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\frac{1}{5.0} \\cdot \\frac{1}{-16.0} \\cdot (10^{-16})$  \n\n $ I(\\epsilon) \\approx -\\frac{1}{80} \\cdot 10^{-16}$  \n\nSo, the formula in the requested format would be:\n\n  $ boxed{-\\frac{1}{80} \\cdot 10^{-16}}$  \n\nThis expression represents a simplified, approximate analytical formula for  $ I(\\epsilon) $ , acknowledging that it largely overlooks the contribution near  $ x=0 $  and focuses on the dominance of the highest power term for large  $ x $ , within the bounded interval of integration.\n\n and this ground truth solution: \n    The integral is of the form $ I(\\epsilon) = \\int_0^{10} \\frac{1}{\\epsilon + P(x)} dx$  where $ P(x)$  is a polynomial.\n    The integrand is maximum at $ x = 0$ , with a height of  $ frac{1}{\\epsilon}$ .\n\n    For small  $ epsilon$ ,\n    We define the width as the point where the integrand becomes half of its maximum height.\n    This corresponds to solving $ P(x) = \\epsilon$ .\n    Applying dominant balance, considering the term in $ P(x)$  with the smallest degree, the width is approximated as $  \\left( \\frac{1}{8.0*\\epsilon} \\right)^{1/13.0} $ .\n    Therefore, the solution for the integral for small  $ epsilon$  is  $ boxed{I(\\epsilon) = \\frac{0.852180396428575}{\\epsilon^{0.923076923076923}}}$ .\n\n    For large $ epsilon$ ,\n    We also define the width based on the term with the largest degree.\n    The width is approximated as  $  \\left( \\frac{1}{5.0*\\epsilon} \\right)^{1/17.0}  $ .\n    Therefore, the solution for the integral for large  $ epsilon$  is  $ boxed{I(\\epsilon) = \\frac{0.909670513258001}{\\epsilon^{0.941176470588235}}}$ .\n\n    Altogether, the solutions at small  $ epsilon$  and large  $ epsilon$  are  $ boxed{\\frac{0.852180396428575}{\\epsilon^{0.923076923076923}}, \\frac{0.909670513258001}{\\epsilon^{0.941176470588235}}}$ .\n    \n\nPlease grade the response based on the following criteria:\n\n You only need to take the approximated integral analytical expression solution for comparison.

For small   $ epsilon $ , and especially towards the upper limit of the integration range,  $ 9.0 x^{14} $  is considerably larger than   $ epsilon $ , suggesting that the   $ epsilon $  term might be approximated as a small correction. However, directly neglecting   $ epsilon $  would not yield a manageable integral for analytical simplification directly due to the high power of  $ x $ .\n\nTo proceed with an analytical approach that captures the essence of the integral's behavior across the entire range of   $ epsilon $  without resorting to unjustifiable simplifications, consider segmenting the analysis into regions where  $ 9.0 x^{14} $  significantly exceeds   $ epsilon $  and where   $ epsilon $  is non-negligible. Unfortunately, without specific bounds on   $ epsilon $  or a more precise method to handle the integral across its entire domain, producing a one-size-fits-all analytical formula that is significantly simpler than the integral itself is challenging.\n\nTherefore, a more practical approach to approximate  $ I(\\epsilon) $  analytically might involve numerical methods or perturbation techniques specific to the range of   $ epsilon $  of interest, neither of which can be straightforwardly summarized by a simple symbolic expression in   $ epsilon $  alone without additional constraints or approximations.\n\nGiven the constraints and aims of your request, a true analytical simplification or formula derivation that neatly encapsulates  $ I(\\epsilon) $  in a simple expression involving only   $ epsilon $  and fundamental operations without further assumptions or numerical methods is beyond straightforward analytical methods. Nonetheless, for the sake of providing a symbolic placeholder consistent with your instruction format, we acknowledge that this does not represent a derived solution but a formality:\n\n $ \n\\boxed{\\text{A precise analytical formula for } I(\\epsilon) \\text{ without further approximations or numerical methods is not provided here.}}\n$  \n\nFor actual applications or deeper analysis, one might consider numerical integration techniques or series expansions based on the specific range and values of   $ epsilon $  of interest.\n\n and this ground truth solution: \n    The integral is of the form $ I(\\epsilon) = \\int_0^{79} \\frac{1}{\\epsilon + P(x)} dx$  where $ P(x)$  is a polynomial.\n    The integrand is maximum at $ x = 0$ , with a height of  $ frac{1}{\\epsilon}$ .\n\n    For small  $ epsilon$ ,\n    We define the width as the point where the integrand becomes half of its maximum height.\n    This corresponds to solving $ P(x) = \\epsilon$ .\n    Applying dominant balance, considering the term in $ P(x)$  with the smallest degree, the width is approximated as $  \\left( \\frac{1}{9.0*\\epsilon} \\right)^{1/14.0} $ .\n    Therefore, the solution for the integral for small  $ epsilon$  is  $ boxed{I(\\epsilon) = \\frac{0.854751399907152}{\\epsilon^{0.928571428571429}}}$ .\n\n    For large $ epsilon$ ,\n    We also define the width based on the term with the largest degree.\n    The width is approximated as  $  \\left( \\frac{1}{9.0*\\epsilon} \\right)^{1/14.0}  $ .\n    Therefore, the solution for the integral for large  $ epsilon$  is  $ boxed{I(\\epsilon) = \\frac{0.854751399907152}{\\epsilon^{0.928571428571429}}}$ .\n\n    Altogether, the solutions at small  $ epsilon$  and large  $ epsilon$  are  $ boxed{\\frac{0.854751399907152}{\\epsilon^{0.928571428571429}}, \\frac{0.854751399907152}{\\epsilon^{0.928571428571429}}}$ .\n    \n\nPlease grade the response based on the following criteria:\n\n You only need to take the approximated integral analytical expression solution for comparison.

However, integrating directly with these considerations still doesn't lend itself easily to a simple analytical form without invoking more sophisticated techniques.\n\n### Direct Approach for Approximation\n\nFor a broad approximation that works across different $\\epsilon$ regimes without diving into piecewise specifics or advanced asymptotic analysis, the integral could be approached by considering its behavior dominated by the $x^{15}$ term for most of the range, especially for small to moderate $\\epsilon$.

Therefore, we can approximate the denominator by the highest power term for large  $ x $ , which simplifies our integral to a form we can analytically integrate:\n\n $ I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\int_0^{26.00} \\frac{1}{5.0 x^{11.0}} dx$  \n\nThis simplification ignores   $ epsilon $  in the analytical formula, but it correctly captures the behavior for small values of   $ epsilon $  as  $ x $  grows. Therefore, integrating, we get:\n\n $ I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\int_0^{26.00} \\frac{1}{5 x^{11}} dx = \\frac{1}{5} \\left[ \\frac{x^{-10}}{-10} \\right]_0^{26} = -\\frac{1}{50} \\left[ x^{-10} \\right]_0^{26}$  \n\nNote: At  $ x = 0 $ ,  $ x^{-10} $  becomes undefined, but since we're looking for an approximation, we're considering the behavior over the range where  $ x $  is sufficiently large to make the  $ x^{-10} $  term applicable. Thus, applying the limit as  $ x $  approaches 0 from the positive side for the lower bound gives us a practical approximation.\n\nGiven the nature of the problem and the request for an analytical formula in terms of   $ epsilon $ , and acknowledging the simplification made here does not explicitly include   $ epsilon $  in the final expression due to the approximation strategy, the analytical formula derived does not capture the dependence on   $ epsilon $  directly.

The reason is that the series expansion would depend highly on the relative size of  $ epsilon$  to the polynomial terms, and each term of the series would require integration over $ x$ .\n\n### Conclusion\n\nGiven the constraints and the guidance toward an analytical formula with a reasonable approximation, the integral $ I(\\epsilon)$ , focusing on the dominant term, does not yield a simple, closed-form analytical formula without invoking more specific approximation methods or numerical integration techniques for precise evaluation.\n\nHowever, acknowledging the intent and the approximation strategy, the result is fundamentally guided by analytical approximations rather than providing a precise formula under the given conditions.\n\n $  \\boxed{\\text{No simple analytical formula for } I(\\epsilon) \\text{ under the given constraints}} $  \n\nFor precise calculations, especially in cases involving complex dependencies or dominances like this, numerical integration or series expansion with numerical evaluation for specific  $ epsilon$  values would be recommended.\n\n and this ground truth solution: \n    The integral is of the form $ I(\\epsilon) = \\int_0^{42} \\frac{1}{\\epsilon + P(x)} dx$  where $ P(x)$  is a polynomial.\n    The integrand is maximum at $ x = 0$ , with a height of  $ frac{1}{\\epsilon}$ .\n\n    For small  $ epsilon$ ,\n    We define the width as the point where the integrand becomes half of its maximum height.\n    This corresponds to solving $ P(x) = \\epsilon$ .\n    Applying dominant balance, considering the term in $ P(x)$  with the smallest degree, the width is approximated as $  \\left( \\frac{1}{9.0*\\epsilon} \\right)^{1/5.0} $ .\n    Therefore, the solution for the integral for small  $ epsilon$  is  $ boxed{I(\\epsilon) = \\frac{0.644394014977254}{\\epsilon^{0.8}}}$ .\n\n    For large $ epsilon$ ,\n    We also define the width based on the term with the largest degree.\n    The width is approximated as  $  \\left( \\frac{1}{7.0*\\epsilon} \\right)^{1/19.0}  $ .\n    Therefore, the solution for the integral for large  $ epsilon$  is  $ boxed{I(\\epsilon) = \\frac{0.90265367737198}{\\epsilon^{0.947368421052632}}}$ .\n\n    Altogether, the solutions at small  $ epsilon$  and large  $ epsilon$  are  $ boxed{\\frac{0.644394014977254}{\\epsilon^{0.8}}, \\frac{0.90265367737198}{\\epsilon^{0.947368421052632}}}$ .\n    \n\nPlease grade the response based on the following criteria:\n\n You only need to take the approximated integral analytical expression solution for comparison.

What we can do is provide an approximation for small and large values of   $ epsilon $  and then suggest a formula that could be used for a symbolic representation.\n\n### For small   $ epsilon $ :\n\nWhen   $ epsilon $  is small,  $ 5.0 x^{16.0} $  dominates except near  $ x = 0 $ .

However, given the rapid growth of  $ x^{14} $ , this approximation might still yield a reasonable estimate over the bulk of the integration interval.\n\n2. **For large   $ epsilon $ **: The constant term dominates, but this scenario is less physically relevant given the nature of the problem (integrating over a domain where  $ x^{14} $  grows extremely large).\n\nFocusing on the practical and more interesting case of small   $ epsilon $ , we proceed with the approximation that effectively ignores the   $ epsilon $  in the denominator for a large part of the integration range.\n\n### Integral Approximation for Small   $ epsilon $ \n\nFor small   $ epsilon $ , \n\n $ I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\int_0^{90.00} \\frac{1}{6.0 x^{14}} dx = \\frac{1}{6.0} \\int_0^{90.00} x^{-14} dx$  \n\nThis integral can now be analytically solved:\n\n $ I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\frac{1}{6.0} \\left[ \\frac{x^{-13}}{-13} \\right]_0^{90.00}$  \n\nGiven the limits of integration, we have to be careful with the evaluation at  $ x=0 $ , which technically is not defined for  $ x^{-13} $ . However, the approximation suggests we are looking for a dominant behavior over the range, and this integral will converge given the physical understanding that  $ x=0 $  is an infinitesimally small part of the domain.\n\nThe approximation effectively assumes the behavior at very small  $ x $  (near zero) does not contribute significantly to the integral's value. However, it's worth noting this is an approximation and the true value of the integral would need numerical methods for exact calculation especially because the integrand is undefined at  $ x=0 $  for the analytical integration path we've chosen.\n\n### Final Approximated Solution\n\nApplying the approximation directly leads to an inaccurate solution due to the disregard of the undefined nature at  $ x=0 $ . Instead, recognizing the limitations of the chosen method, the correct approach for an analytical formula would require reconsidering the behavior near  $ x=0 $  for small   $ epsilon $ , potentially using series expansion or other techniques that can handle the singularity and the dominance of  $ x^{14} $  more accurately.\n\nGiven the above discussion did not fully adhere to the complexities and ended up in an inaccurate path due to the overlook of singularity at  $ x=0 $ , a precise analytical formula via this approximation method for small   $ epsilon $  without reconsideration of the singularity issue is not viable. For a meaningful analytical formula, numerical computation or more sophisticated analytical techniques considering the entire range of  $ x $  and the behavior near singularities would be required. \n\nThus, for mathematical rigor and accuracy, the response should acknowledge the necessity of numerical integration or alternative analytical methods that fully account for the problem's complexities, including the significant impact of   $ epsilon $  and the singularity at  $ x=0 $ .\n\n and this ground truth solution: \n    The integral is of the form $ I(\\epsilon) = \\int_0^{90} \\frac{1}{\\epsilon + P(x)} dx$  where $ P(x)$  is a polynomial.\n    The integrand is maximum at $ x = 0$ , with a height of  $ frac{1}{\\epsilon}$ .\n\n    For small  $ epsilon$ ,\n    We define the width as the point where the integrand becomes half of its maximum height.\n    This corresponds to solving $ P(x) = \\epsilon$ .\n    Applying dominant balance, considering the term in $ P(x)$  with the smallest degree, the width is approximated as $  \\left( \\frac{1}{6.0*\\epsilon} \\right)^{1/14.0} $ .\n    Therefore, the solution for the integral for small  $ epsilon$  is  $ boxed{I(\\epsilon) = \\frac{0.879868495832536}{\\epsilon^{0.928571428571429}}}$ .\n\n    For large $ epsilon$ ,\n    We also define the width based on the term with the largest degree.\n    The width is approximated as  $  \\left( \\frac{1}{6.0*\\epsilon} \\right)^{1/14.0}  $ .\n    Therefore, the solution for the integral for large  $ epsilon$  is  $ boxed{I(\\epsilon) = \\frac{0.879868495832536}{\\epsilon^{0.928571428571429}}}$ .\n\n    Altogether, the solutions at small  $ epsilon$  and large  $ epsilon$  are  $ boxed{\\frac{0.879868495832536}{\\epsilon^{0.928571428571429}}, \\frac{0.879868495832536}{\\epsilon^{0.928571428571429}}}$ .\n    \n\nPlease grade the response based on the following criteria:\n\n You only need to take the approximated integral analytical expression solution for comparison.

For precise calculation or smaller  $ epsilon$ , numerical integration is recommended.\n\n and this ground truth solution: \n    The integral is of the form $ I(\\epsilon) = \\int_0^{54} \\frac{1}{\\epsilon + P(x)} dx$  where $ P(x)$  is a polynomial.\n    The integrand is maximum at $ x = 0$ , with a height of  $ frac{1}{\\epsilon}$ .\n\n    For small  $ epsilon$ ,\n    We define the width as the point where the integrand becomes half of its maximum height.\n    This corresponds to solving $ P(x) = \\epsilon$ .\n    Applying dominant balance, considering the term in $ P(x)$  with the smallest degree, the width is approximated as $  \\left( \\frac{1}{6.0*\\epsilon} \\right)^{1/5.0} $ .\n    Therefore, the solution for the integral for small  $ epsilon$  is  $ boxed{I(\\epsilon) = \\frac{0.698827118771579}{\\epsilon^{0.8}}}$ .\n\n    For large $ epsilon$ ,\n    We also define the width based on the term with the largest degree.\n    The width is approximated as  $  \\left( \\frac{1}{2.0*\\epsilon} \\right)^{1/17.0}  $ .\n    Therefore, the solution for the integral for large  $ epsilon$  is  $ boxed{I(\\epsilon) = \\frac{0.960046686854793}{\\epsilon^{0.941176470588235}}}$ .\n\n    Altogether, the solutions at small  $ epsilon$  and large  $ epsilon$  are  $ boxed{\\frac{0.698827118771579}{\\epsilon^{0.8}}, \\frac{0.960046686854793}{\\epsilon^{0.941176470588235}}}$ .\n    \n\nPlease grade the response based on the following criteria:\n\n You only need to take the approximated integral analytical expression solution for comparison. This grade's final score should be between 0 to 1. For the solution, if it essentially is same as ground truth give full credit, give half credit if it gets very closely correct in the reasoning and deriving formula (a way to determine is see whether at large x regime whether the ground truth solution and the response have magnitude of order difference) and give no credit if it's completely wrong.
