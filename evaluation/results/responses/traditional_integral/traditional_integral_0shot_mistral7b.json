For small values of  $epsilon$, we can use a Taylor series expansion for the denominator around $x=0$:\n\n```python\nsmall_epsilon = [\"\\epsilon\", \"5.0 * x^9.0\"]\nsmall_approximation = r\"\\boxed{\\left[\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{(-1)^n}{n!} \\epsilon^{n+1}} \\frac{(5.0)^{n+1}}{(9.0 n + 1)!}, \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{(-1)^n}{n!} \\epsilon^{n+1}} \\frac{(5.0)^{n+1}}{(9.0 n + 1)!}\\right]}\"\n```\n\nNote that the Taylor series expansion for the denominator is an infinite sum, but we can truncate it to a finite number of terms depending on the desired accuracy.\n\nThese approximations provide analytical formulas for $I(\\epsilon)$ in different regimes of  $epsilon$. The large_approximation formula gives a simple approximation when  $epsilon$ is large, while the small_approximation formula uses a Taylor series expansion when  $epsilon$ is small.\n\n and this ground truth         solution: \n    The integral is of the form $I(\\epsilon) = \\int_0^{25} \\frac{1}{\\epsilon + P(x)} dx$ where $P(x)$ is a polynomial. Thus, its value can be estimated as the product between a height and a width.\n    Since the integrand is maximized at $x = 0$, the height can be set to  $frac{1}{\\epsilon}$.\n\n    For small  $epsilon$,\n    we define the width as the point where the integrand becomes half of its maximum height.\n    This corresponds to solving for $x$ given $P(x) = \\epsilon$.\n    Applying dominant balance, considering the term in $P(x)$ with the smallest degree, the width is approximated as $ \\left( \\frac{1}{5.0*\\epsilon} \\right)^{1/9.0} $.\n    Therefore, the analytical approximation of the integral for small  $epsilon$ is  $boxed{I(\\epsilon) = \\frac{0.8363}{\\epsilon^{0.8889}}}$.\n\n    For an intermediate regime where  $epsilon$ is large,\n    we also define the width based on the term with the largest degree.\n    The width is approximated as  $ \\left( \\frac{1}{5.0*\\epsilon} \\right)^{1/9.0}  $.\n    Therefore, the analytical approximation of the integral for large  $epsilon$ is  $boxed{I(\\epsilon) = \\frac{0.8363}{\\epsilon^{0.8889}}}$.\n\n    If the width of the integral exceeds the range of integration, we consider one more regime for very large  $epsilon$.\n    The width is then just the range of integration, so in this regime, the integral can be approximated as  $frac{L}{\\epsilon}$.\n    Therefore, the analytical approximation of the integral for very large  $epsilon$ is  $boxed{I(\\epsilon) = \\frac{25}{\\epsilon}}$.\n\n    Altogether, the solutions at small, large, and very large  $epsilon$ are  $boxed{\\frac{0.8363}{\\epsilon^{0.8889}}, \\frac{0.8363}{\\epsilon^{0.8889}}, \\frac{25}{\\epsilon}}$.\n     and grade the response based on the following criteria:\n\n1) Check both the small and large $\\epsilon$ solutions.         2) For each solution, give full credit if it matches the formula in the answer key;         give no credit if it is completely wrong and briefly state the reason for the error.         3) Average the scores for the small and large epsilon solutions to obtain a final score between 0 and 1.        4) Give the final grading as a float in Latex boxed format \\[boxed{}\\",

Thus, its value can be estimated as the product between a height and a width.\n    Since the integrand is maximized at $x = 0$, the height can be set to  $frac{1}{\\epsilon}$.\n\n    For small  $epsilon$,\n    we define the width as the point where the integrand becomes half of its maximum height.\n    This corresponds to solving for $x$ given $P(x) = \\epsilon$.\n    Applying dominant balance, considering the term in $P(x)$ with the smallest degree, the width is approximated as $ \\left( \\frac{1}{5.0*\\epsilon} \\right)^{1/4.0} $.\n    Therefore, the analytical approximation of the integral for small  $epsilon$ is  $boxed{I(\\epsilon) = \\frac{0.6687}{\\epsilon^{0.75}}}$.\n\n    For an intermediate regime where  $epsilon$ is large,\n    we also define the width based on the term with the largest degree.\n    The width is approximated as  $ \\left( \\frac{1}{1.0*\\epsilon} \\right)^{1/13.0}  $.\n    Therefore, the analytical approximation of the integral for large  $epsilon$ is  $boxed{I(\\epsilon) = \\frac{1.0}{\\epsilon^{0.75}}}$.\n\n    If the width of the integral exceeds the range of integration, we consider one more regime for very large  $epsilon$.\n    The width is then just the range of integration, so in this regime, the integral can be approximated as  $frac{L}{\\epsilon}$.\n    Therefore, the analytical approximation of the integral for very large  $epsilon$ is  $boxed{I(\\epsilon) = \\frac{87}{\\epsilon}}$.\n\n    Altogether, the solutions at small, large, and very large  $epsilon$ are  $boxed{\\frac{0.6687}{\\epsilon^{0.75}}, \\frac{1.0}{\\epsilon^{0.75}}, \\frac{87}{\\epsilon}}$.\n     and grade the response based on the following criteria:\n\n1) Check both the small and large $\\epsilon$ solutions.         2) For each solution, give full credit if it matches the formula in the answer key;         give no credit if it is completely wrong and briefly state the reason for the error.         3) Average the scores for the small and large epsilon solutions to obtain a final score between 0 and 1.        4) Give the final grading as a float in Latex boxed format \\[boxed{}\\",

Small  $epsilon$ ( $epsilon \\ll 1$)\n\nIn this regime, we can neglect the terms with higher powers of $x$ compared to  $epsilon x^5$. Thus, the integrand becomes approximately  $frac{1}{\\epsilon}$.\n\n```python\nsmall_epsilon = [Sympify('epsilon'), Sympify('1')]\nsmall_approximation = r'\\boxed{\\epsilon^{-1}}'\n```\n\n2. Moderate  $epsilon$ ($1 \\leq \\epsilon \\leq 10^2$)\n\nIn this regime, the terms with higher powers of $x$ are significant compared to  $epsilon x^5$. We can approximate the integrand using a Taylor series expansion around $x=0$.\n\n```python\nmoderate_epsilon = [Sympify('epsilon'), Sympify('1')]\nmoderate_approximation = r'\\boxed{I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\int_0^{85.00} \\left( \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{(-1)^n}{n!} \\left(\\frac{\\epsilon}{7}\\right)^{n+1} x^{5n+5} + \\cdots \\right) dx}'\n```\n\n3. Large  $epsilon$ ( $epsilon > 10^2$)\n\nIn this regime, the term with the highest power of $x$ dominates the integrand. Thus, we can approximate the integrand by neglecting all other terms.\n\n```python\nlarge_epsilon = [Sympify('0'), Sympify('7')]\nlarge_approximation = r'\\boxed{I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\int_0^{85.00} \\frac{1}{7 x^{17}} dx}'\n```\n\n and this ground truth         solution: \n    The integral is of the form $I(\\epsilon) = \\int_0^{85} \\frac{1}{\\epsilon + P(x)} dx$ where $P(x)$ is a polynomial. Thus, its value can be estimated as the product between a height and a width.\n    Since the integrand is maximized at $x = 0$, the height can be set to  $frac{1}{\\epsilon}$.\n\n    For small  $epsilon$,\n    we define the width as the point where the integrand becomes half of its maximum height.\n    This corresponds to solving for $x$ given $P(x) = \\epsilon$.\n    Applying dominant balance, considering the term in $P(x)$ with the smallest degree, the width is approximated as $ \\left( \\frac{1}{7.0*\\epsilon} \\right)^{1/5.0} $.\n    Therefore, the analytical approximation of the integral for small  $epsilon$ is  $boxed{I(\\epsilon) = \\frac{0.6776}{\\epsilon^{0.8}}}$.\n\n    For an intermediate regime where  $epsilon$ is large,\n    we also define the width based on the term with the largest degree.\n    The width is approximated as  $ \\left( \\frac{1}{6.0*\\epsilon} \\right)^{1/17.0}  $.\n    Therefore, the analytical approximation of the integral for large  $epsilon$ is  $boxed{I(\\epsilon) = \\frac{0.6988}{\\epsilon^{0.8}}}$.\n\n    If the width of the integral exceeds the range of integration, we consider one more regime for very large  $epsilon$.\n    The width is then just the range of integration, so in this regime, the integral can be approximated as  $frac{L}{\\epsilon}$.\n    Therefore, the analytical approximation of the integral for very large  $epsilon$ is  $boxed{I(\\epsilon) = \\frac{85}{\\epsilon}}$.\n\n    Altogether, the solutions at small, large, and very large  $epsilon$ are  $boxed{\\frac{0.6776}{\\epsilon^{0.8}}, \\frac{0.6988}{\\epsilon^{0.8}}, \\frac{85}{\\epsilon}}$.\n     and grade the response based on the following criteria:\n\n1) Check both the small and large $\\epsilon$ solutions.         2) For each solution, give full credit if it matches the formula in the answer key;         give no credit if it is completely wrong and briefly state the reason for the error.         3) Average the scores for the small and large epsilon solutions to obtain a final score between 0 and 1.        4) Give the final grading as a float in Latex boxed format \\[boxed{}\\",
