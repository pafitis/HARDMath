This means we can use Laplace's method to develop an analytical approximation in the limit that $x \\to \\infty$. \\par In this limit, the integral will be dominated by the integrand near the maximum of $f(t)$ within the bounds $[-0.8, 0.4]$. So, to simplify the integral, we will expand the integrand around this maximum. \\par In this case, we can find the maximum of $f(t) = - 0.8 t^{5}$ on the interval analytically. We begin by looking for critical point(s) $t_{crit}$ of $f(t)$ by solving $f'(t) = - 4.0 t^{4} = 0$ for $t$. This gives us that $t_{crit} = [0]$. To find the maximum on this interval, we evaluate $f(t)$ at the critical point(s) $t_{crit}$ and the bounds $-0.8$ and $0.4$. We take the $t$ that gives the largest value.

We find that there are no critical points of $f(t) \\in (-1.0, -0.1)$. This means that its minimum must be on the bounds. Comparing the values of $f(t)$ on the bounds, we find that its minimum occurs at $t_0 = a = -1.0$. \\par Since the integral is dominated by the value of the integrand near a, we Taylor expand the integrand around this point. \\begin{equation} I(x) =  \\int_{a}^{b} (g(a) + (t-a)g'(a)+...) e^{- x (f(a) + (t-a) f'(a) + ...)} \\, dt \\end{equation} We can then approximate \\begin{equation} I(x) \\approx \\int_{a}^{b} g(a) e^{- x (f(a) + (t-a) f'(a))} \\, dt \\end{equation} Pulling out the constant in the integral gives \\begin{equation} I(x) \\approx g(a) e^{- x f(a)} \\int_{a}^{b} e^{- x (t-a) f'(a)}  \\, dt \\end{equation} \\par Since $x$ is large, we perform the change of variables $u = x (t-a) |f'(a)|$, rewriting the integral as \\begin{equation} I(x) \\approx g(a) e^{- x f(a)} \\int_{0}^{x (b-a) |f'(a)|} \\frac{1}{x |f'(a)|} e^{-u} \\, dt \\end{equation} Since $x \\to \\infty$, we approximate this with new bounds as \\begin{equation} I(x) \\approx g(a) e^{- x f(a)} \\frac{1}{x |f'(a)|} \\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{-u} \\, dt \\end{equation} \\par Solving the integral and evaluating, we find that \\par \\begin{equation} \\boxed{I(x) \\approx - \\frac{0.185260928188993 e^{2.92787595947439 x}}{x}} \\end{equation}  and grade the response based on the following criteria:\n\n1) Check the large $x$ final solution.         2) Give full credit if it matches the formula in the answer key;         give half credit if the response get to the checkpoint where it correctly identifies         \\(t_0\\) where $f$ attains its maximum and attempt performing Taylor's expansion around         it but the final answer is wrong; give no credit if it is completely wrong.         3) For both partial and no credit briefly state the error reason.        4) Give the final grading as a float in Latex boxed format \\[boxed{}\\]",

We must approximate it numerically. We will use the a few iterations of the dual annealing algorithm to achieve this. Using a few iterations of dual annealing, we find that the minimum of $f(t)$ occurs at $t_0 = [0.5751]$. \\par Since the integral is dominated by the value of the integrand near 0.5751, we Taylor expand the integrand around this point. \\begin{equation} I(x) =  \\int_{a}^{b} (g(0.5751) + (t-0.5751)g'(0.5751)+...) e^{- x (f(0.5751) + (t-0.5751) f'(0.5751) + \\frac{(t-0.5751)^2}{2} f''(0.5751) +...)} \\end{equation}But $f'(0.5751) = 0$ by definition, so we can remove this term from the exponent.
