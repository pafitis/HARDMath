So, to simplify the integral, we will expand the integrand around this minimum. \\par In this case, we can find the minimum of $f(t) = - 0.7 \\sin{\\left(t \\right)}$ on the interval analytically.

        "response": " To find an approximate analytical formula for `I(x)` as `x` approaches infinity, we can use the following steps:\n\n1. Break down the integral into three parts based on the terms inside the integral function.\n2. Analyze each term separately and find their asymptotic behavior as `x` goes to infinity.\n3. Combine the results to get an approximate formula for `I(x)`.\n\nLet's analyze each term:\n\n1. The first term is a polynomial in `t`, specifically `-0.8 t^5`. Since it's a polynomial, its integral will grow at most polynomially as `x` goes to infinity.\n2. The second term is also a polynomial in `t`, specifically `2.3 t^4`. Similar to the first term, this term will grow at most polynomially as `x` goes to infinity.\n3. The third term involves the natural logarithm function and the trigonometric sine function. As `x` goes to infinity, the exponential term `e^{- x (- 1.8 sin(t))}` will dominate the integral due to its rapid decay property.

Break down the integral into three parts based on the terms inside the integral function.\n2. Analyze each term separately and find their asymptotic behavior as `x` goes to infinity.\n3. Combine the results to get an approximate formula for `I(x)`.\n\nLet's analyze each term:\n\n1. The first term is a polynomial in `t`, specifically `-0.8 t^5`. Since it's a polynomial, its integral will grow at most polynomially as `x` goes to infinity.\n2. The second term is also a polynomial in `t`, specifically `2.3 t^4`. Similar to the first term, this term will grow at most polynomially as `x` goes to infinity.\n3. The third term involves the natural logarithm function and the trigonometric sine function. As `x` goes to infinity, the exponential term `e^{- x (- 1.8 sin(t))}` will dominate the integral due to its rapid decay property. To find an approximate formula for this term, we can use the following approximation:\n   - For small values of `t`, `sin(t)` is approximately equal to `t`. In this case, `-0.9` and `-0.3` are not small compared to 1, but we can still use this approximation for a rough estimate.\n   - Replace `sin(t)` with `t` in the exponential term, and then integrate from `-0.9` to `-0.3`.

The integral part still needs to be evaluated numerically or approximated using other methods.\n\n and this ground truth         solution: The integral is of the form \\begin{equation} I(x) = \\int_{a}^{b} g(t) e^{- x f(t)} \\, dt \\end{equation} \\par where $a=-0.9$, $b=-0.3$, $g(t) = - 0.8 t^{5} + 2.3 t^{4} - 1.0 \\operatorname{atan}{\\left(t \\right)}$, and $f(t) = - 1.8 \\sin{\\left(t \\right)}$. This means we can use Laplace's method to develop an analytical approximation in the limit that $x \\to \\infty$. \\par In this limit, the integral will be dominated by the integrand near the minimum of $f(t)$ within the bounds $[-0.9, -0.3]$. So, to simplify the integral, we will expand the integrand around this minimum. \\par In this case, we can find the minimum of $f(t) = - 1.8 \\sin{\\left(t \\right)}$ on the interval analytically. We begin by looking for critical point(s) $t_{crit}$ of $f(t)$ by solving $f'(t) = - 1.8 \\cos{\\left(t \\right)} = 0$ for $t$. We find that there are no critical points of $f(t) \\in (-0.9, -0.3)$. This means that its minimum must be on the bounds. Comparing the values of $f(t)$ on the bounds, we find that its minimum occurs at $t_0 = b = -0.3$. \\par Since the integral is dominated by the value of the integrand near b, we Taylor expand the integrand around this point. \\begin{equation} I(x) =  \\int_{a}^{b} (g(b) + (t-b)g'(b)+...) e^{- x (f(b) + (t-b) f'(b) + ...)} \\, dt \\end{equation} We can then approximate \\begin{equation} I(x) \\approx \\int_{a}^{b} g(b) e^{- x (f(b) + (t-b) f'(b))} \\, dt \\end{equation} Pulling out the constant in the integral gives \\begin{equation} I(x) \\approx g(b) e^{- x f(b)} \\int_{a}^{b} e^{- x (t-b) f'(b)}  \\, dt \\end{equation} \\par Since $x$ is large, we perform the change of variables $u = x (t-b) |f'(b)|$. Note $f'(b) < 0$ since it is a minimum. So, rewriting the integral, we get \\begin{equation} I(x) \\approx g(b) e^{- x f(b)} \\int_{x (a-b) |f'(b)|}^{0} \\frac{1}{x |f'(b)|} e^{u} \\, dt \\end{equation} Since $x \\to \\infty$, we approximate this with new bounds as \\begin{equation} I(x) \\approx g(b) e^{- x f(b)} \\frac{1}{x |f'(b)|} \\int_{-\\infty}^{0} e^{u} \\, dt \\end{equation} \\par Solving the integral and evaluating, we find that \\par \\begin{equation} \\boxed{I(x) \\approx \\frac{0.181454852138283 e^{- 0.531936371990411 x}}{x}} \\end{equation}  and grade the response based on the following criteria:\n\n1) Check the large $x$ final solution.         2) Give full credit if it matches the formula in the answer key;         give half credit if the response get to the checkpoint where it correctly identifies         \\(t_0\\) where $f$ attains its maximum and attempt performing Taylor's expansion around         it but the final answer is wrong; give no credit if it is completely wrong.         3) For both partial and no credit briefly state the error reason.        4) Give the final grading as a float in Latex boxed format \\[boxed{}\\]",

        "response": " To find an approximate analytical formula for `I(x)` as `x` approaches infinity, we can use the method of stationary points (Lagrange's method).

        "grade_prompt": "Please take this response:  To find an approximate analytical formula for `I(x)` as `x` approaches infinity, we can use the method of stationary points (Lagrange's method). First, let's find the critical points of the exponent inside the integral.\n\nThe derivative of the exponent with respect to `t` is:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, diff, Function, lambdify\nx, t = symbols('x t')\nf = 2.6*t**5 + 1.9*t**4 - 1.4*t**2\ndf_dt = diff(f, t)\n```\n\nSetting the derivative equal to zero and solving for `t` gives us the critical points:\n\n```python\ncritical_points = solve([df_dt], t)\n```\n\nNow, we can use Taylor series expansion around each critical point to approximate the integral. Let's assume there is only one real root (which seems to be the case for the given function). We will use the Maclaurin series since all our critical points are at `t=0`.\n\n```python\n# Assuming there is only one real root at t=0\ndef taylor_series(func, n):\n    return sum((func.subs(t, 0) * (t**k) / factorial(k)) for k in range(1+n))\n\n# Taylor series expansion of the exponent around t=0 up to order 5\nexp_taylor = taylor_series(f, 5)\n```\n\nNow, we can approximate the integral using the Taylor series:\n\n```python\ndef I(x):\n    # Integrand without the exponential term\n    integrand = (2.9*t**5 + 1.8*t**4 + 2.8*atan(t))\n\n    # Approximating the integral using Taylor series expansion of the exponent around t=0 up to order 5\n    I_approx = integrate(integrand, (t, -0.0, 0.6)).subs(exp(-x*f), exp(-x*exp_taylor))\n\n    return I_approx\n```\n\nFinally, we can present the solution in a LaTeX boxed format:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Latex\nprint(Latex(I(x)))\n```\n\nThis will output:\n\n```\n\\boxed{\n  I(x) = \\int_{-0.0}^{0.6} (2.9 t^{5} + 1.8 t^{4} + 2.8 \\operatorname{atan}{\\left(t \\right)}) e^{- x (2.6 t^{5} + 1.9 t^{4} -

So, to simplify the integral, we will expand the integrand around this minimum. \\par In this case, we can find the minimum of $f(t) = 2.6 t^{5} + 1.9 t^{4} - 1.4 t^{2}$ on the interval analytically. We begin by looking for critical point(s) $t_{crit}$ of $f(t)$ by solving $f'(t) = 13.0 t^{4} + 7.6 t^{3} - 2.8 t = 0$ for $t$. This gives us that $t_{crit} = [0.455137201554065, 0]$. To find the minimum on this interval, we evaluate $f(t)$ at the critical point(s) $t_{crit}$ and the bounds $-0.0$ and $0.6$. We take the $t$ that gives the smallest value. Here, this minimum $t_0 = [0.455137201554065]$. \\par Since the integral is dominated by the value of the integrand near 0.455137201554065, we Taylor expand the integrand around this point. \\begin{equation} I(x) =  \\int_{a}^{b} (g(0.455137201554065) + (t-0.455137201554065)g'(0.455137201554065)+...) e^{- x (f(0.455137201554065) + (t-0.455137201554065) f'(0.455137201554065) + \\frac{(t-0.455137201554065)^2}{2} f''(0.455137201554065) +...)} \\end{equation}But $f'(0.455137201554065) = 0$ by definition, so we can remove this term from the exponent.

We can assume that this point will give us the dominant contribution to the integral as `x` approaches infinity.\n\n```python\ncritical_point = critical_points[0] if abs(critical_points[0]) > abs(critical_points[1]) else critical_points[1]\n```\n\nNext, we'll approximate the integral using Laplace's method:\n\n```python\nh = 0.6/len(critical_point)  # partition size\nI_approx = (-2.3*critical_point)*sqrt(2*pi*h)*exp(x*(f(critical_point)))*sum((-2.3*t)*exp(x*(f(critical_point + h*i) - f(critical_point))) for i in range(len(critical_point)))\n```\n\nFinally, we'll convert the SymPy expression to a LaTeX boxed format:\n\n```python\nfrom IPython.display import Math\nMath(r'\\boxed{' + lambdify((x), I_approx)(10) + '}')\n```\n\nThis will give you an approximate analytical formula for `I(x)` as `x` approaches infinity, expressed in LaTeX format.\n\n and this ground truth         solution: The integral is of the form \\begin{equation} I(x) = \\int_{a}^{b} g(t) e^{+ x f(t)} \\, dt \\end{equation} \\par where $a=-0.6$, $b=0.6$, $g(t) = - 2.3 t$, and $f(t) = 0.2 t^{3} - 1.5 t + 0.4 \\operatorname{atan}{\\left(t \\right)}$. This means we can use Laplace's method to develop an analytical approximation in the limit that $x \\to \\infty$. \\par In this limit, the integral will be dominated by the integrand near the maximum of $f(t)$ within the bounds $[-0.6, 0.6]$. So, to simplify the integral, we will expand the integrand around this maximum. \\par In this case, we can find the maximum of $f(t) = 0.2 t^{3} - 1.5 t + 0.4 \\operatorname{atan}{\\left(t \\right)}$ on the interval analytically. We begin by looking for critical point(s) $t_{crit}$ of $f(t)$ by solving $f'(t) = 0.6 t^{2} - 1.5 + \\frac{0.4}{t^{2} + 1} = 0$ for $t$. We find that there are no critical points of $f(t) \\in (-0.6, 0.6)$. This means that its maximum must be on the bounds. Comparing the values of $f(t)$ on the bounds, we find that its maximum occurs at $t_0 = a = -0.6$. \\par Since the integral is dominated by the value of the integrand near a, we Taylor expand the integrand around this point. \\begin{equation} I(x) =  \\int_{a}^{b} (g(a) + (t-a)g'(a)+...) e^{+ x (f(a) + (t-a) f'(a) + ...)} \\, dt \\end{equation} We can then approximate \\begin{equation} I(x) \\approx \\int_{a}^{b} g(a) e^{+ x (f(a) + (t-a) f'(a))} \\, dt \\end{equation} Pulling out the constant in the integral gives \\begin{equation} I(x) \\approx g(a) e^{+ x f(a)} \\int_{a}^{b} e^{+ x (t-a) f'(a)}  \\, dt \\end{equation} \\par Since $x$ is large, we perform the change of variables $u = x (t-a) |f'(a)|$. Note $f'(a) < 0$ since it is a maximum. So, rewriting the integral, we get \\begin{equation} I(x) \\approx g(a) e^{+ x f(a)} \\int_{0}^{x (b-a) |f'(a)|} \\frac{1}{x |f'(a)|} e^{-u} \\, dt \\end{equation} Since $x \\to \\infty$, we approximate this with new bounds as \\begin{equation} I(x) \\approx g(a) e^{+ x f(a)} \\frac{1}{x |f'(a)|} \\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{-u} \\, dt \\end{equation} \\par Solving the integral and evaluating, we find that \\par \\begin{equation} \\boxed{I(x) \\approx \\frac{1.39410506299025 e^{0.640632199891766 x}}{x}} \\end{equation}  and grade the response based on the following criteria:\n\n1) Check the large $x$ final solution.         2) Give full credit if it matches the formula in the answer key;         give half credit if the response get to the checkpoint where it correctly identifies         \\(t_0\\) where $f$ attains its maximum and attempt performing Taylor's expansion around         it but the final answer is wrong; give no credit if it is completely wrong.         3) For both partial and no credit briefly state the error reason.        4) Give the final grading as a float in Latex boxed format \\[boxed{}\\]",

This means we can use Laplace's method to develop an analytical approximation in the limit that $x \\to \\infty$. \\par In this limit, the integral will be dominated by the integrand near the maximum of $f(t)$ within the bounds $[-0.5, 0.1]$. So, to simplify the integral, we will expand the integrand around this maximum. \\par In this case, we can find the maximum of $f(t) = 0.9 t^{4}$ on the interval analytically. We begin by looking for critical point(s) $t_{crit}$ of $f(t)$ by solving $f'(t) = 3.6 t^{3} = 0$ for $t$. This gives us that $t_{crit} = [0]$. To find the maximum on this interval, we evaluate $f(t)$ at the critical point(s) $t_{crit}$ and the bounds $-0.5$ and $0.1$. We take the $t$ that gives the largest value. Here, this maximum $t_0 = [-0.5]$. \\par Since the integral is dominated by the value of the integrand near a, we Taylor expand the integrand around this point. \\begin{equation} I(x) =  \\int_{a}^{b} (g(a) + (t-a)g'(a)+...) e^{+ x (f(a) + (t-a) f'(a) + ...)} \\, dt \\end{equation} We can then approximate \\begin{equation} I(x) \\approx \\int_{a}^{b} g(a) e^{+ x (f(a) + (t-a) f'(a))} \\, dt \\end{equation} Pulling out the constant in the integral gives \\begin{equation} I(x) \\approx g(a) e^{+ x f(a)} \\int_{a}^{b} e^{+ x (t-a) f'(a)}  \\, dt \\end{equation} \\par Since $x$ is large, we perform the change of variables $u = x (t-a) |f'(a)|$.

This means we can use Laplace's method to develop an analytical approximation in the limit that $x \\to \\infty$. \\par In this limit, the integral will be dominated by the integrand near the minimum of $f(t)$ within the bounds $[-0.6, 0.5]$. So, to simplify the integral, we will expand the integrand around this minimum. \\par In this case, we can find the minimum of $f(t) = - 0.9 t - 0.3 \\sin{\\left(t \\right)}$ on the interval analytically. We begin by looking for critical point(s) $t_{crit}$ of $f(t)$ by solving $f'(t) = - 0.3 \\cos{\\left(t \\right)} - 0.9 = 0$ for $t$. We find that there are no critical points of $f(t) \\in (-0.6, 0.5)$. This means that its minimum must be on the bounds. Comparing the values of $f(t)$ on the bounds, we find that its minimum occurs at $t_0 = b = 0.5$. \\par Since the integral is dominated by the value of the integrand near b, we Taylor expand the integrand around this point. \\begin{equation} I(x) =  \\int_{a}^{b} (g(b) + (t-b)g'(b)+...) e^{- x (f(b) + (t-b) f'(b) + ...)} \\, dt \\end{equation} We can then approximate \\begin{equation} I(x) \\approx \\int_{a}^{b} g(b) e^{- x (f(b) + (t-b) f'(b))} \\, dt \\end{equation} Pulling out the constant in the integral gives \\begin{equation} I(x) \\approx g(b) e^{- x f(b)} \\int_{a}^{b} e^{- x (t-b) f'(b)}  \\, dt \\end{equation} \\par Since $x$ is large, we perform the change of variables $u = x (t-b) |f'(b)|$. Note $f'(b) < 0$ since it is a minimum. So, rewriting the integral, we get \\begin{equation} I(x) \\approx g(b) e^{- x f(b)} \\int_{x (a-b) |f'(b)|}^{0} \\frac{1}{x |f'(b)|} e^{u} \\, dt \\end{equation} Since $x \\to \\infty$, we approximate this with new bounds as \\begin{equation} I(x) \\approx g(b) e^{- x f(b)} \\frac{1}{x |f'(b)|} \\int_{-\\infty}^{0} e^{u} \\, dt \\end{equation} \\par Solving the integral and evaluating, we find that \\par \\begin{equation} \\boxed{I(x) \\approx - \\frac{1.14130604683664 e^{0.593827661581261 x}}{x}} \\end{equation}  and grade the response based on the following criteria:\n\n1) Check the large $x$ final solution.         2) Give full credit if it matches the formula in the answer key;         give half credit if the response get to the checkpoint where it correctly identifies         \\(t_0\\) where $f$ attains its maximum and attempt performing Taylor's expansion around         it but the final answer is wrong; give no credit if it is completely wrong.         3) For both partial and no credit briefly state the error reason.        4) Give the final grading as a float in Latex boxed format \\[boxed{}\\]",

Using a few iterations of dual annealing, we find that the minimum of $f(t)$ occurs at $t_0 = [-0.0]$. \\par Since the integral is dominated by the value of the integrand near -0.0, we Taylor expand the integrand around this point. \\begin{equation} I(x) =  \\int_{a}^{b} (g(-0.0) + (t--0.0)g'(-0.0)+...) e^{- x (f(-0.0) + (t--0.0) f'(-0.0) + \\frac{(t--0.0)^2}{2} f''(-0.0) +...)} \\end{equation}But $f'(-0.0) = 0$ by definition, so we can remove this term from the exponent.

Here, this minimum $t_0 = [0.494464011669938]$. \\par Since the integral is dominated by the value of the integrand near 0.494464011669938, we Taylor expand the integrand around this point. \\begin{equation} I(x) =  \\int_{a}^{b} (g(0.494464011669938) + (t-0.494464011669938)g'(0.494464011669938)+...) e^{- x (f(0.494464011669938) + (t-0.494464011669938) f'(0.494464011669938) + \\frac{(t-0.494464011669938)^2}{2} f''(0.494464011669938) +...)} \\end{equation}But $f'(0.494464011669938) = 0$ by definition, so we can remove this term from the exponent. We can then approximate \\begin{equation} I(x) \\approx \\int_{a}^{b} g(0.494464011669938) e^{- x (f(0.494464011669938) + \\frac{(t-0.494464011669938)^2}{2} f''(0.494464011669938))} \\, dt \\end{equation} \\par Which equals \\par \\begin{equation} = g(0.494464011669938) e^{- x f(0.494464011669938)} \\int_{a}^{b} e^{- x (\\frac{(t-0.494464011669938)^2}{2} f''(0.494464011669938))} \\, dt \\end{equation} \\par Because $x$ is large, we perform the change of variables $u = \\sqrt{x \\frac{|f''(0.494464011669938)|}{2}}(t-0.494464011669938)$, rewriting the integral as \\begin{equation} g(0.494464011669938) e^{- x f(0.494464011669938)} \\int_{\\sqrt{x \\frac{|f''(0.494464011669938)|}{2}} (a-0.494464011669938)}^{\\sqrt{x \\frac{|f''(0.494464011669938)|}{2}} (b-0.494464011669938)} \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{x |f''(0.494464011669938)|}} e^{-u^2} \\, dt \\end{equation} \\par Since $x \\to \\infty$, we approximate this as \\begin{equation} g(0.494464011669938) e^{- x f(0.494464011669938)} \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{x |f''(0.494464011669938)|} } \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{-u^2} \\, dt \\end{equation} \\par Solving the integral and evaluating, we find that \\par \\begin{equation} \\boxed{I(x) \\approx - 1.10079622608727 \\sqrt{\\pi} \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{x}} e^{0.336115597708488 x}} \\end{equation} and grade the response based on the following criteria:\n\n1) Check the large $x$ final solution.         2) Give full credit if it matches the formula in the answer key;         give half credit if the response get to the checkpoint where it correctly identifies         \\(t_0\\) where $f$ attains its maximum and attempt performing Taylor's expansion around         it but the final answer is wrong; give no credit if it is completely wrong.         3) For both partial and no credit briefly state the error reason.        4) Give the final grading as a float in Latex boxed format \\[boxed{}\\]",
