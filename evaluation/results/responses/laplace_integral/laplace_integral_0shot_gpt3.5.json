We begin by looking for critical point(s) $ t_{crit}$  of $ f(t)$  by solving $ f'(t) = - 4.0 t^{4} = 0$  for $ t$ . This gives us that $ t_{crit} = [0]$ . To find the maximum on this interval, we evaluate $ f(t)$  at the critical point(s) $ t_{crit}$  and the bounds $ -0.8$  and $ 0.4$ . We take the $ t$  that gives the largest value. Here, this maximum $ t_0 = [-0.8]$ . \\par Since the integral is dominated by the value of the integrand near a, we Taylor expand the integrand around this point. \\begin{equation} I(x) =  \\int_{a}^{b} (g(a) + (t-a)g'(a)+...) e^{+ x (f(a) + (t-a) f'(a) + ...)} \\, dt \\end{equation} We can then approximate \\begin{equation} I(x) \\approx \\int_{a}^{b} g(a) e^{+ x (f(a) + (t-a) f'(a))} \\, dt \\end{equation} Pulling out the constant in the integral gives \\begin{equation} I(x) \\approx g(a) e^{+ x f(a)} \\int_{a}^{b} e^{+ x (t-a) f'(a)}  \\, dt \\end{equation} \\par Since $ x$  is large, we perform the change of variables $ u = x (t-a) |f'(a)|$ . Note $ f'(a) < 0$  since it is a maximum. So, rewriting the integral, we get \\begin{equation} I(x) \\approx g(a) e^{+ x f(a)} \\int_{0}^{x (b-a) |f'(a)|} \\frac{1}{x |f'(a)|} e^{-u} \\, dt \\end{equation} Since $ x \\to \\infty$ , we approximate this with new bounds as \\begin{equation} I(x) \\approx g(a) e^{+ x f(a)} \\frac{1}{x |f'(a)|} \\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{-u} \\, dt \\end{equation} \\par Solving the integral and evaluating, we find that \\par \\begin{equation} \\boxed{I(x) \\approx - \\frac{1.52512899090701 e^{0.262144 x}}{x}} \\end{equation} \n\nPlease grade the response based on the following criteria:\n\n You only need to take the approximated integral analytical expression solution for comparison.

So, to simplify the integral, we will expand the integrand around this minimum. \\par However, it is impossible to compute the minimum of $ f(t)$  on the bounds analytically. We must approximate it numerically. We will use the a few iterations of the dual annealing algorithm to achieve this. Using a few iterations of dual annealing, we find that the minimum of $ f(t)$  occurs at $ t_0 = [-0.3]$ . \\par Since the integral is dominated by the value of the integrand near b, we Taylor expand the integrand around this point. \\begin{equation} I(x) =  \\int_{a}^{b} (g(b) + (t-b)g'(b)+...) e^{- x (f(b) + (t-b) f'(b) + ...)} \\, dt \\end{equation} We can then approximate \\begin{equation} I(x) \\approx \\int_{a}^{b} g(b) e^{- x (f(b) + (t-b) f'(b))} \\, dt \\end{equation} Pulling out the constant in the integral gives \\begin{equation} I(x) \\approx g(b) e^{- x f(b)} \\int_{a}^{b} e^{- x (t-b) f'(b)}  \\, dt \\end{equation} \\par Since $ x$  is large, we perform the change of variables $ u = x (t-b) |f'(b)|$ . Note $ f'(b) < 0$  since it is a minimum. So, rewriting the integral, we get \\begin{equation} I(x) \\approx g(b) e^{- x f(b)} \\int_{x (a-b) |f'(b)|}^{0} \\frac{1}{x |f'(b)|} e^{u} \\, dt \\end{equation} Since $ x \\to \\infty$ , we approximate this with new bounds as \\begin{equation} I(x) \\approx g(b) e^{- x f(b)} \\frac{1}{x |f'(b)|} \\int_{-\\infty}^{0} e^{u} \\, dt \\end{equation} \\par Solving the integral and evaluating, we find that \\par \\begin{equation} \\boxed{I(x) \\approx - \\frac{0.00627129372713599 e^{- 1.49831089920396 x}}{x}} \\end{equation} \n\nPlease grade the response based on the following criteria:\n\n You only need to take the approximated integral analytical expression solution for comparison.

So, to simplify the integral, we will expand the integrand around this minimum. \\par However, it is impossible to compute the minimum of $ f(t)$  on the bounds analytically. We must approximate it numerically. We will use the a few iterations of the dual annealing algorithm to achieve this. Using a few iterations of dual annealing, we find that the minimum of $ f(t)$  occurs at $ t_0 = [-0.0]$ . \\par Since the integral is dominated by the value of the integrand near -0.0, we Taylor expand the integrand around this point. \\begin{equation} I(x) =  \\int_{a}^{b} (g(-0.0) + (t--0.0)g'(-0.0)+...) e^{- x (f(-0.0) + (t--0.0) f'(-0.0) + \\frac{(t--0.0)^2}{2} f''(-0.0) +...)} \\end{equation}But $ f'(-0.0) = 0$  by definition, so we can remove this term from the exponent.
