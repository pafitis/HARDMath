Comparing the values of $ f(t)$  on the bounds, we find that its minimum occurs at $ t_0 = b = 0.3$ . \\par Since the integral is dominated by the value of the integrand near b, we Taylor expand the integrand around this point. \\begin{equation} I(x) =  \\int_{a}^{b} (g(b) + (t-b)g'(b)+...) e^{- x (f(b) + (t-b) f'(b) + ...)} \\, dt \\end{equation} We can then approximate \\begin{equation} I(x) \\approx \\int_{a}^{b} g(b) e^{- x (f(b) + (t-b) f'(b))} \\, dt \\end{equation} Pulling out the constant in the integral gives \\begin{equation} I(x) \\approx g(b) e^{- x f(b)} \\int_{a}^{b} e^{- x (t-b) f'(b)}  \\, dt \\end{equation} \\par Since $ x$  is large, we perform the change of variables $ u = x (t-b) |f'(b)|$ . Note $ f'(b) < 0$  since it is a minimum. So, rewriting the integral, we get \\begin{equation} I(x) \\approx g(b) e^{- x f(b)} \\int_{x (a-b) |f'(b)|}^{0} \\frac{1}{x |f'(b)|} e^{u} \\, dt \\end{equation} Since $ x \\to \\infty$ , we approximate this with new bounds as \\begin{equation} I(x) \\approx g(b) e^{- x f(b)} \\frac{1}{x |f'(b)|} \\int_{-\\infty}^{0} e^{u} \\, dt \\end{equation} \\par Solving the integral and evaluating, we find that \\par \\begin{equation} \\boxed{I(x) \\approx \\frac{0.322997637046038 e^{0.206864144662938 x}}{x}} \\end{equation}\n\n\nQuestion: Consider the integral \\par \\begin{equation} I(x) = \\int_{-0.0}^{0.6} (2.9 t^{5} + 1.8 t^{4} + 2.8 \\operatorname{atan}{\\left(t \\right)}) e^{- x (2.6 t^{5} + 1.9 t^{4} - 1.4 t^{2})} \\, dt \\end{equation} \\par Develop an analytical formula for $I(x)$ that is accurate as $x \\to \\infty$.\nHint: Please use reasonable approximations and answer the question requiring an answer in a SymPy convertable formula containing only variable \\(x\\) (not other dummy variables) and math operation expressions and provide the final answer, e.g., \\(x^{3}\\) inside a Latex boxed format \\[boxed{}\\].\nSolution:",

We begin by looking for critical point(s) $ t_{crit}$  of $ f(t)$  by solving $ f'(t) = - 0.7 \\cos{\\left(t \\right)} = 0$  for $ t$ . We find that there are no critical points of $ f(t) \\in (-1.0, 0.3)$ . This means that its minimum must be on the bounds. Comparing the values of $ f(t)$  on the bounds, we find that its minimum occurs at $ t_0 = b = 0.3$ . \\par Since the integral is dominated by the value of the integrand near b, we Taylor expand the integrand around this point. \\begin{equation} I(x) =  \\int_{a}^{b} (g(b) + (t-b)g'(b)+...) e^{- x (f(b) + (t-b) f'(b) + ...)} \\, dt \\end{equation} We can then approximate \\begin{equation} I(x) \\approx \\int_{a}^{b} g(b) e^{- x (f(b) + (t-b) f'(b))} \\, dt \\end{equation} Pulling out the constant in the integral gives \\begin{equation} I(x) \\approx g(b) e^{- x f(b)} \\int_{a}^{b} e^{- x (t-b) f'(b)}  \\, dt \\end{equation} \\par Since $ x$  is large, we perform the change of variables $ u = x (t-b) |f'(b)|$ . Note $ f'(b) < 0$  since it is a minimum.

Thus, the response does not meet the criteria of being \"very closely correct\" in the reasoning and deriving the formula.\n\n### Final Grade:\nSince the response does not provide a comparable final analytical expression and lacks detailed steps, it does not deserve partial credit.

This means we can use Laplace's method to develop an analytical approximation in the limit that $ x \\to \\infty$ . \\par In this limit, the integral will be dominated by the integrand near the minimum of $ f(t)$  within the bounds $ [-1.0, 0.3]$ . So, to simplify the integral, we will expand the integrand around this minimum. \\par In this case, we can find the minimum of $ f(t) = - 0.7 \\sin{\\left(t \\right)}$  on the interval analytically. We begin by looking for critical point(s) $ t_{crit}$  of $ f(t)$  by solving $ f'(t) = - 0.7 \\cos{\\left(t \\right)} = 0$  for $ t$ . We find that there are no critical points of $ f(t) \\in (-1.0, 0.3)$ . This means that its minimum must be on the bounds.
