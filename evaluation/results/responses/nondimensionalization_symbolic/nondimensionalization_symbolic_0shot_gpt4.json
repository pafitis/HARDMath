        "response": "To nondimensionalize the given polynomial \\[a_{1}x^{7} + a_{2}x^{2} + a_{3},\\] into the form \\[\\epsilon y^{7} + y^{2} + 1,\\] we start by introducing a nondimensional variable \\(y = \\frac{x}{L}\\), where \\(L\\) is a characteristic length scale to be determined.\n\nOur goal is to express \\(x\\) in terms of \\(y\\) so that we can substitute back into the original polynomial and match the coefficients to the target form.

Typically, the constant term in the nondimensional form is set through a different type of normalization, like choosing \\(a_3\\) to match or adjusting other parameters.

        "response": "To nondimensionalize the given polynomial\n\\[a_{1} x^{9} + a_{2} x^{8} + a_{3}\\]\ninto the form\n\\[\\epsilon y^{9} + y^{8} + 1,\\]\nwe start by finding a characteristic scale for \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) such that \\(x\\) can be expressed in terms of a nondimensional variable \\(y\\) (i.e., \\(x = L y\\), where \\(L\\) is the characteristic length scale).\n\nThe goal is to express each term of the original polynomial in terms of powers of \\(y\\) and factor out any constants to match the desired form. Given the structure of the target polynomial, we can seek a transformation that directly addresses the coefficients \\(a_{1}\\), \\(a_{2}\\), and \\(a_{3}\\).\n\nFirst, let's express \\(x\\) in terms of a nondimensional variable \\(y\\) such that \\(x = L y\\). Substituting \\(x\\) in terms of \\(y\\) into the original polynomial, we get:\n\\[a_{1} (Ly)^{9} + a_{2} (Ly)^{8} + a_{3} = a_{1} L^{9} y^{9} + a_{2} L^{8} y^{8} + a_{3}.\\]\n\nTo match the target form, we normalize terms by dividing the entire expression by \\(a_{3}\\) to make the constant term equal to 1:\n\\[a_{1} L^{9} y^{9} + a_{2} L^{8} y^{8} + 1.\\]\n\nFor the coefficient of \\(y^{8}\\) to be 1, we set \\(a_{2} L^{8} = 1\\), which implies:\n\\[L^{8} = \\frac{1}{a_{2}} \\implies L = \\left(\\frac{1}{a_{2}}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{8}}.\\]\n\nSubstituting \\(L\\) back into the \\(y^{9}\\) term's coefficient gives us \\(\\epsilon\\):\n\\[\\epsilon = a_{1} L^{9} = a_{1} \\left(\\frac{1}{a_{2}}\\right)^{\\frac{9}{8}}.\\]\n\nThus, \\(\\epsilon\\) as a function of \\(a_1\\), \\(a_2\\), and \\(a_3\\) is:\n\\[\\boxed{\\epsilon = a_{1} \\left(\\frac{1}{a_{2}}\\right)^{\\frac{9}{8}}}.\\]",
