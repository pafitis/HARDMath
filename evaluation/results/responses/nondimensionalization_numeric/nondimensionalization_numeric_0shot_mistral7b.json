Let's assume that the dimensions of $x$ are [L] (length) and the dimensions of $P(x)$ are [M][T]^{-2} (Mass times Time squared, which is the units for acceleration).\n\nWe can make $x$ dimensionless by scaling it with a characteristic length $\\ell$, i.e., $y = \\frac{x}{\\ell}$. Similarly, we can make $P(x)$ dimensionless by scaling it with a characteristic acceleration $a_0$. Let's denote the dimensionless polynomial as $Q(y)$.\n\nNow, let's find the expressions for $Q(y)$ in terms of $P(x)$, $\\ell$, and $a_0$:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nQ(y) &= \\frac{P(x)}{a_0} \\\\\n&= \\frac{6 x^{8} - 9 x^{4} - 4}{a_0} \\\\\n&= \\frac{6 (\\frac{y \\ell}{\\ell})^8 - 9 (\\frac{y \\ell}{\\ell})^4 - 4}{a_0} \\\\\n&= \\frac{6 y^8 \\ell^8 - 9 y^4 \\ell^4 - 4 \\ell^8}{a_0 \\ell^8} \\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\nTo make $Q(y)$ a polynomial of the form $\\epsilon y^{8} \\pm y^{4} \\pm 1$, we need to choose $\\ell$ and $a_0$ such that:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\frac{\\ell^8}{a_0 \\ell^8} &= \\epsilon \\\\\n\\Rightarrow a_0 &= \\epsilon \\ell^8 \\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\nNow, let's choose $\\ell = 1$ for simplicity. Then, we have:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\na_0 &= \\epsilon \\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\nSo, the nondimensionalized polynomial is:\n\n\\[\nQ(y) = \\epsilon y^{8} - y^{4} - 1\n\\]\n\nNow, we can solve for $\\epsilon$ by comparing coefficients with the original polynomial $P(x)$. Let's denote the coefficients of the original polynomial as follows:\n\n- Coefficient of $x^8$: 6 (denoted as $C_8$)\n- Coefficient of $x^4$: -9 (denoted as $C_4$)\n- Constant term: -4 (denoted as $C_0$)\n\nNow, let's compare the coefficients of the nondimensionalized polynomial with those of the original polynomial:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nC_8 &= \\epsilon \\\\\nC_4 &= -1 \\\\\nC_0 &= -1 \\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\nSince $C_8$ and $C_0$ are equal, we have $\\epsilon = 6$. However, the coefficient of $y^4$ in the nondimensionalized polynomial is $-1$, while it should be $-9$ according to the original polynomial. To correct this discrepancy, we can multiply the entire nondimensionalized polynomial by a factor of 3:\n\n\\[\nQ(y) = 3 \\epsilon y^{8} - 3 y^{4} - 3\n\\]\n\nNow, comparing coefficients again, we have:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nC_8 &= 3 \\epsilon \\\\\nC_4 &= -3 \\\\\nC_0 &= -3 \\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\nThis time, the coefficient of $y^4$ is correct. So, we have $\\epsilon = \\frac{6}{3} = 2$. However, this value of $\\epsilon$ does not satisfy the condition that $a_0 = \\epsilon \\ell^8$, since $\\ell = 1$. To resolve this issue, we can choose a different characteristic length $\\ell$. Let's try $\\ell = \\sqrt[8]{6}$, which satisfies the condition:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\na_0 &= \\epsilon \\\\\n\\Rightarrow \\sqrt[8]{6} &= \\epsilon^{1/8} \\\\\n\\Rightarrow \\epsilon &= 6 \\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\nNow, we have the nondimensionalized polynomial:\n\n\\[\nQ(y) = 6 y^{8} - 3 y^{4} - 1\n\\]\n\nThis is a polynomial of the desired form with $\\epsilon = 6$. The final answer is given in Latex format as follows:\n\n\\[boxed{\\epsilon = 6}\\]",
