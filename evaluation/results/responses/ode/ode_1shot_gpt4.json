However, given the constraints of providing a simple analytical expression and the complexity of accurately capturing the behavior of  $ y'^2 $ , we acknowledge that finding a precise form for large  $ x $  without further approximation or analysis methods is challenging.\n\nGiven these considerations and focusing on keeping the solution analytical and within the scope of the provided instructions, a detailed analysis surpassing basic assumptions is necessary for a rigorous solution in the large  $ x $  regime, which may involve numerical methods or deeper qualitative analysis beyond simple ansatz-based approaches.\n\nTherefore, the provided solution for the small  $ x $  regime, acknowledging the limitations and without a precise solution for the large  $ x $  regime due to the complexity of the equation, is:\n  $ boxed{[y = 1 - x + \\frac{x^2}{2} - \\frac{x^3}{6}, y = \\text{Complex analysis required for large } x]}$  \n\nThis acknowledges the initial analytical attempt for small  $ x $  while recognizing the need for a more sophisticated approach to accurately address the large  $ x $  behavior of the given differential equation.\n\n and this ground truth solution: The dominant balance in the small x regime is given by $  $ frac{d^{3}}{d x^{3}} y = e^{- x},$ $  and the dominant balance in the large x regime is given by $  $ frac{d^{3}}{d x^{3}} y = \\left(\\frac{d}{d x} y\\right)^{2}$ $ \nUsing the dominant balance in the small x regime, the solution can be derived by     setting $ x=0$ , analytically solving the dominant balance equation     for y, and plugging in the initial conditions. The solution is thus $ $ y{\\left(x \\right)} = \\frac{x^{3}}{6} + 1$ $  in the small x regime.\n\nThe solution for the large  $  x  $  regime uses an ansatz of the form \n$ $  y = \\alpha (x - x^*)^p, $ $  \nwhere  $  x^*  $  is the divergence point. Plugging in the ansatz and solving for the terms yields \n$ $ \n\\alpha p \\left(p - 2\\right) \\left(p - 1\\right) \\left(x - 4.98049804980498\\right)^{p - 3} = \\alpha^{2} p^{2} \\left(x - 4.98049804980498\\right)^{2 p - 2}\n$ $ \n\nAfter substituting the derivatives, the equation is reorganized to collect terms with respect to  $  (x - x^*)  $ . This leads to an equation where the coefficients and powers of  $  (x - x^*)  $  are equated on both sides. Simplifying the equation gives us two separate equations, one for the coefficients and another for the powers of  $  (x - x^*)  $ .\n\nThe coefficients' equation is:\n$ $ \n\\alpha p \\left(p - 2\\right) \\left(p - 1\\right) = \\alpha^{2} p^{2}\n$ $ \n\nThe powers' equation is:\n$ $ \np - 3 = 2 p - 2\n$ $ \n\nSolving this system of equations provides the values of  $  \\alpha  $  and  $  p  $ . \nA valid solution is identified if  $  \\alpha  $  and  $  p  $  are both nonzero. \nIn such a case, the solution for  $  \\alpha  $  and  $  p  $  is found to be:\n$ $ \n\\alpha = -6, \\quad p = -1\n$ $ \n\nWith these values, the integration constant  $  C  $  is determined by substituting \na known point from the numerical solution into the ansatz.

Without a detailed derivation (which requires matching coefficients and powers of \\(x\\) after substituting the ansatz and solving for \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(p\\)), we look for a solution that characterizes the dominant balance idea without explicitly solving the nonlinear equation, which often leads to a logarithmic or inverse relation in practice for such nonlinearity.\n\nConsidering the nonlinear nature and the influence of \\(y'^2\\), a legitimate assumption for large \\(x\\) could resemble an inverse or logarithmic function, reflecting slow growth as \\(x\\) increases.

        "grade_prompt": "Please take this response: To find the analytical expressions that approximate the solution of  $ y(x) $  in the small  $ x $  and large  $ x $  regimes for the given differential equation\n\n $ y''' = - \\frac{y}{5} + y'^{2} - \\frac{y''}{5 x^{3} - 3 x + 8} - \\frac{1}{x^{3} - \\sin{\\left(x \\right)} + 4},$  \n\nwith initial conditions at  $ x = 0 $ ,\n $ \n\\begin{align*}\ny(0) &= 1.00, \\\\\ny'(0) &= 0.00, \\\\\ny''(0) &= 0.00,\n\\end{align*}\n$  \n\nwe proceed as follows:\n\n### Small  $ x $  Regime\nIn the small  $ x $  regime, we consider terms that dominate as  $ x \\rightarrow 0 $ . The term  $ -\\frac{y}{5} $  and the constant term in the differential equation will be most relevant since the other terms involve  $ x $  in the denominator (making them less dominant as  $ x \\rightarrow 0 $ ). Hence, the dominant balance is given by\n\n $ y''' = -\\frac{y}{5}.$  \n\nWith the given initial conditions, this resembles a simple linear homogeneous differential equation. Assuming a solution of the form  $ y = e^{rx} $ , we substitute back into the equation to find  $ r $ . However, for simplicity and direct integration considering initial conditions:\n\nGiven  $ y(0) = 1 $ , a simple polynomial solution that can satisfy the initial conditions and the form of the simplified differential equation is  $ y(x) = 1 - \\frac{x^3}{30} $  for small  $ x $ , which satisfies  $ y(0) = 1 $ , and approximately fits the behavior of our simplified ODE near  $ x = 0 $ .\n\n### Large  $ x $  Regime\nFor large  $ x $ , the dominant term becomes  $ y'^2 $  because the terms involving  $ x $  in the denominators become negligible compared to  $ y'^2 $ , especially as  $ x $  grows large. Hence, the dominant balance is given by\n\n $ y''' = y'^2.$  \n\nAssuming an ansatz  $ y = \\alpha x^p $  leads to a complex nonlinear equation. However, for large  $ x $ , a common approach is to consider solutions that reflect the nonlinear growth influenced by  $ y'^2 $ . Without a detailed derivation (which requires matching coefficients and powers of  $ x $  after substituting the ansatz and solving for   $ alpha $  and  $ p $ ), we look for a solution that characterizes the dominant balance idea without explicitly solving the nonlinear equation, which often leads to a logarithmic or inverse relation in practice for such nonlinearity.\n\nConsidering the nonlinear nature and the influence of  $ y'^2 $ , a legitimate assumption for large  $ x $  could resemble an inverse or logarithmic function, reflecting slow growth as  $ x $  increases. However, without explicit solving, stating a generic form is speculative.\n\nGiven the complexity and to remain consistent with the provided structure, a speculative approximation considering the influence of  $ y'^2 $  for large  $ x $  can be encapsulated by an inverse relation, acknowledging that precise derivation would require further nonlinear analysis.\n\nThus, the solution might be expressed as follows for educational purposes:\n\n $ \n\\boxed{[y = 1 - \\frac{x^3}{30}, y = C_1 + C_2 \\log(x)]}\n$  \n\nwhere  $ C_1 $  and  $ C_2 $  are constants determined by boundary conditions or further matching requirements.

The solution is thus $ $ y{\\left(x \\right)} = 1 - \\frac{x^{3}}{24}$ $  in the small x regime.\n\nThe solution for the large  $  x  $  regime uses an ansatz of the form \n$ $  y = \\alpha (x - x^*)^p, $ $  \nwhere  $  x^*  $  is the divergence point. Plugging in the ansatz and solving for the terms yields \n$ $ \n\\alpha p \\left(p - 2\\right) \\left(p - 1\\right) \\left(x - 7.58075807580758\\right)^{p - 3} = \\alpha^{2} p^{2} \\left(x - 7.58075807580758\\right)^{2 p - 2}\n$ $ \n\nAfter substituting the derivatives, the equation is reorganized to collect terms with respect to  $  (x - x^*)  $ . This leads to an equation where the coefficients and powers of  $  (x - x^*)  $  are equated on both sides. Simplifying the equation gives us two separate equations, one for the coefficients and another for the powers of  $  (x - x^*)  $ .\n\nThe coefficients' equation is:\n$ $ \n\\alpha p \\left(p - 2\\right) \\left(p - 1\\right) = \\alpha^{2} p^{2}\n$ $ \n\nThe powers' equation is:\n$ $ \np - 3 = 2 p - 2\n$ $ \n\nSolving this system of equations provides the values of  $  \\alpha  $  and  $  p  $ . \nA valid solution is identified if  $  \\alpha  $  and  $  p  $  are both nonzero. \nIn such a case, the solution for  $  \\alpha  $  and  $  p  $  is found to be:\n$ $ \n\\alpha = -6, \\quad p = -1\n$ $ \n\nWith these values, the integration constant  $  C  $  is determined by substituting \na known point from the numerical solution into the ansatz.

However, recognizing the challenge and the nature of the balance, an informed guess could lean towards exponential or logarithmic functions due to the nature of the dominant $ y'^4$  term.\n\nGiven these considerations and the constraints of the task, we prepare to provide the simplified expressions in the requested format:\n\n $ \n\\boxed{[y = 1 + \\frac{x^3}{12}, y = \\text{A complex function reflecting the large x regime's behavior}]}\n$  \n\nSince providing an explicit form for the large $ x$  regime without further simplifications or assumptions is challenging and not directly requested, the above box illustrates the approach rather than a definitive solution for the large $ x$  regime.\n\n and this ground truth solution: The dominant balance in the small x regime is given by $  $ frac{d^{3}}{d x^{3}} y = \\frac{1}{\\cos{\\left(x \\right)} - 2},$ $  and the dominant balance in the large x regime is given by $  $ frac{d^{3}}{d x^{3}} y = \\left(\\frac{d}{d x} y\\right)^{4}$ $ \nUsing the dominant balance in the small x regime, the solution can be derived by     setting $ x=0$ , analytically solving the dominant balance equation     for y, and plugging in the initial conditions. The solution is thus $ $ y{\\left(x \\right)} = 1 - \\frac{x^{3}}{6}$ $  in the small x regime.\n\nThe solution for the large  $  x  $  regime uses an ansatz of the form \n$ $  y = \\alpha (x - x^*)^p, $ $  \nwhere  $  x^*  $  is the divergence point. Plugging in the ansatz and solving for the terms yields \n$ $ \n\\alpha p \\left(p - 2\\right) \\left(p - 1\\right) \\left(x - 7.14071407140714\\right)^{p - 3} = \\alpha^{4} p^{4} \\left(x - 7.14071407140714\\right)^{4 p - 4}\n$ $ \n\nAfter substituting the derivatives, the equation is reorganized to collect terms with respect to  $  (x - x^*)  $ . This leads to an equation where the coefficients and powers of  $  (x - x^*)  $  are equated on both sides. Simplifying the equation gives us two separate equations, one for the coefficients and another for the powers of  $  (x - x^*)  $ .\n\nThe coefficients' equation is:\n$ $ \n\\alpha p \\left(p - 2\\right) \\left(p - 1\\right) = \\alpha^{4} p^{4}\n$ $ \n\nThe powers' equation is:\n$ $ \np - 3 = 4 p - 4\n$ $ \n\nSolving this system of equations provides the values of  $  \\alpha  $  and  $  p  $ . \nA valid solution is identified if  $  \\alpha  $  and  $  p  $  are both nonzero. \nIn such a case, the solution for  $  \\alpha  $  and  $  p  $  is found to be:\n$ $ \n\\alpha = \\sqrt[3]{30}, \\quad p = \\frac{1}{3}\n$ $ \n\nWith these values, the integration constant  $  C  $  is determined by substituting \na known point from the numerical solution into the ansatz. This yields the following equation for  $  C  $ :\n$ $ \n1.96813493424491 = C - 0.448155413667484 \\cdot \\sqrt[3]{30}\n$ $ \n\nSolving this equation, we find the value of  $  C  $  to be:\n$ $ \nC = 3.36065800331171,\n$ $ \n\nso, the analytical approximation for the solution at large $ x$  (near the divergence point) is given by\n$ $ \ny = \\sqrt[3]{30} (x - 7.14071407140714)^{\\frac{1}{3}} + (3.36065800331171),\n$ $ \n\nand the analytical approximation for the solution at small $ x$  is given by\n$ $ \ny = 1 - \\frac{x^{3}}{6}.\n$ $ \n\nThus, the solution is given by \n$  $ boxed{[y = 1 - \\frac{x^{3}}{6}, y = \\sqrt[3]{30} (x - 7.14071407140714)^{\\frac{1}{3}} + (3.36065800331171)]}$ $ \n\n\n\nPlease grade the response based on the following criteria:\n\n You only need to take the analytical expression solutions for small and large x regimes in response and solution for comparison.

For large  $ x $ , assuming a solution of the form  $ y = ax^p $  could lead to a dominant balance that matches the form of the differential equation, but finding  $ a $  and  $ p $  explicitly requires more information or constraints.\n\nGiven the complexity of solving these exactly and the requirement to provide a concise answer, we propose an approximation for small  $ x $  based on the simplified equation and acknowledge that for large  $ x $ , the solution involves a more complex expression that cannot be easily determined without numerical methods or further assumptions.\n\nThus, the final list of approximate solutions in both regimes, respecting the format requested, is:\n\n $ \n\\boxed{[y = 1 - \\frac{x^3}{5} + \\frac{x^4}{20}, \\text{ \\textit{For large } x, a more complex expression involving } y'^5 \\text{ \\textit{is suggested, which cannot be easily simplified without further constraints.}}]}\n$  \n\nThis response provides a direct answer for small  $ x $  and acknowledges the complexity of finding a precise form for large  $ x $  analytically.\n\n and this ground truth solution: The dominant balance in the small x regime is given by $  $ frac{d^{3}}{d x^{3}} y = e^{- x},$ $  and the dominant balance in the large x regime is given by $  $ frac{d^{3}}{d x^{3}} y = \\left(\\frac{d}{d x} y\\right)^{5}$ $ \nUsing the dominant balance in the small x regime, the solution can be derived by     setting $ x=0$ , analytically solving the dominant balance equation     for y, and plugging in the initial conditions.

Plugging in the ansatz and solving for the terms yields \n$ $ \n\\alpha p \\left(p - 2\\right) \\left(p - 1\\right) \\left(x - 3.15031503150315\\right)^{p - 3} = \\alpha^{4} p^{4} \\left(x - 3.15031503150315\\right)^{4 p - 4}\n$ $ \n\nAfter substituting the derivatives, the equation is reorganized to collect terms with respect to  $  (x - x^*)  $ . This leads to an equation where the coefficients and powers of  $  (x - x^*)  $  are equated on both sides. Simplifying the equation gives us two separate equations, one for the coefficients and another for the powers of  $  (x - x^*)  $ .\n\nThe coefficients' equation is:\n$ $ \n\\alpha p \\left(p - 2\\right) \\left(p - 1\\right) = \\alpha^{4} p^{4}\n$ $ \n\nThe powers' equation is:\n$ $ \np - 3 = 4 p - 4\n$ $ \n\nSolving this system of equations provides the values of  $  \\alpha  $  and  $  p  $ . \nA valid solution is identified if  $  \\alpha  $  and  $  p  $  are both nonzero. \nIn such a case, the solution for  $  \\alpha  $  and  $  p  $  is found to be:\n$ $ \n\\alpha = \\sqrt[3]{30}, \\quad p = \\frac{1}{3}\n$ $ \n\nWith these values, the integration constant  $  C  $  is determined by substituting \na known point from the numerical solution into the ansatz.

Similarly, the term $25x - \\cos(x) + 2$ simplifies to its constant component because the $\\cos(x)$ term is approximately 1 at $x = 0$, and the $25x$ term is negligible. Hence, the simplified differential equation becomes:\n\n\\[\ny''' = - \\frac{y}{2} - \\frac{1}{3}\n\\]\n\nTo solve this, we assume a solution of the form $y(x) = Ax^n$ for some constants $A$ and $n$ and possibly add a constant term to match the initial conditions.

Thus, an approximate solution form could be:\n\n $ y(x) \\approx 1 + \\frac{x^3}{7\\cdot3!}$  \n\n### Large  $ x $  Regime\nFor large  $ x $ ,  $ y'^{2} $  could be the dominant term since it grows faster with  $ x $  compared to the algebraically decreasing/increasing terms of  $ y $  and  $ y'' $ .\n\nAssuming a solution form like  $ y = \\alpha (x - x^*)^p $  and considering  $ y'^2 $  as the dominant term, we get:\n\n $ y'^2 \\sim \\alpha^2 p^2 (x - x^*)^{2p-2}$  \n\nMatching this with the derivative terms on the left gives an indication that the power of  $ x $  in our solution is critical. A more detailed solution would involve finding  $ p $  that balances the growth of  $ y'^2 $  with the other terms for large  $ x $ , but without specific coefficients, this remains an educated conjecture for large  $ x $  behavior.\n\n### Solution List\nGiven the nature of the question and focusing on the provided hints for formulating a response suitable for conversion into SymPy, the approximate solutions for small  $ x $  and a general approach for large  $ x $  might look like:\n\n $ \n\\boxed{[y = 1 + \\frac{x^3}{42}, y = \\alpha (x - x^*)^p]}\n$  \n\nThis box contains a place-holder for the large  $ x $  solution because the exact form requires further analysis to solve for   $ alpha $ ,  $ p $ , and  $ x^* $ , which are not trivially determined from the given information without additional assumptions or numerical methods.\n\n and this ground truth solution: The dominant balance in the small x regime is given by $  $ frac{d^{3}}{d x^{3}} y = \\frac{1}{6 x^{3} + \\sin{\\left(x \\right)} + 7},$ $  and the dominant balance in the large x regime is given by $  $ frac{d^{3}}{d x^{3}} y = \\left(\\frac{d}{d x} y\\right)^{2}$ $ \nUsing the dominant balance in the small x regime, the solution can be derived by     setting $ x=0$ , analytically solving the dominant balance equation     for y, and plugging in the initial conditions. The solution is thus $ $ y{\\left(x \\right)} = \\frac{x^{3}}{42} + 1$ $  in the small x regime.\n\nThe solution for the large  $  x  $  regime uses an ansatz of the form \n$ $  y = \\alpha (x - x^*)^p, $ $  \nwhere  $  x^*  $  is the divergence point. Plugging in the ansatz and solving for the terms yields \n$ $ \n\\alpha p \\left(p - 2\\right) \\left(p - 1\\right) \\left(x - 7.43074307430743\\right)^{p - 3} = \\alpha^{2} p^{2} \\left(x - 7.43074307430743\\right)^{2 p - 2}\n$ $ \n\nAfter substituting the derivatives, the equation is reorganized to collect terms with respect to  $  (x - x^*)  $ . This leads to an equation where the coefficients and powers of  $  (x - x^*)  $  are equated on both sides. Simplifying the equation gives us two separate equations, one for the coefficients and another for the powers of  $  (x - x^*)  $ .\n\nThe coefficients' equation is:\n$ $ \n\\alpha p \\left(p - 2\\right) \\left(p - 1\\right) = \\alpha^{2} p^{2}\n$ $ \n\nThe powers' equation is:\n$ $ \np - 3 = 2 p - 2\n$ $ \n\nSolving this system of equations provides the values of  $  \\alpha  $  and  $  p  $ . \nA valid solution is identified if  $  \\alpha  $  and  $  p  $  are both nonzero. \nIn such a case, the solution for  $  \\alpha  $  and  $  p  $  is found to be:\n$ $ \n\\alpha = -6, \\quad p = -1\n$ $ \n\nWith these values, the integration constant  $  C  $  is determined by substituting \na known point from the numerical solution into the ansatz. This yields the following equation for  $  C  $ :\n$ $ \n61.947322460332 = C + 66.66\n$ $ \n\nSolving this equation, we find the value of  $  C  $  to be:\n$ $ \nC = -4.712677539668,\n$ $ \n\nso, the analytical approximation for the solution at large $ x$  (near the divergence point) is given by\n$ $ \ny = -6 (x - 7.43074307430743)^{-1} + (-4.712677539668),\n$ $ \n\nand the analytical approximation for the solution at small $ x$  is given by\n$ $ \ny = \\frac{x^{3}}{42} + 1.\n$ $ \n\nThus, the solution is given by \n$  $ boxed{[y = \\frac{x^{3}}{42} + 1, y = -6 (x - 7.43074307430743)^{-1} + (-4.712677539668)]}$ $ \n\n\n\nPlease grade the response based on the following criteria:\n\n You only need to take the analytical expression solutions for small and large x regimes in response and solution for comparison. This grade's final score should be between 0 to 1. You need to consider both the small and large x solutions.

        "grade_prompt": "Please take this response: For this problem, we will analyze the given differential equation in both the small $ x$  and the large $ x$  regimes to find approximate analytical expressions for $ y(x)$ . The differential equation provided is:\n\n $ y''' = - \\frac{y}{3} + y'^{2} - \\frac{y''}{9 x^{2} + 12} + \\frac{1}{- 3 x^{4} + 3 x^{3} + 6 x^{2} + \\cos{(x)} - 3}$  \n\nGiven initial conditions at $ x = 0$  are:\n $ y(0) = 1.00, \\quad y'(0) = 0.00, \\quad y''(0) = 0.00$  \n\n### Small $ x$  Regime\nIn the small $ x$  regime, we focus on terms that are dominant as $ x \\to 0$ . The term  $ frac{1}{- 3 x^{4} + 3 x^{3} + 6 x^{2} + \\cos{(x)} - 3}$  can be simplified to  $ frac{1}{\\cos{(x)} - 3}$  because the cosine function and the constant term dominate. The other terms are simplified to their constant components due to their $ x$  dependence diminishing as $ x \\to 0$ . Therefore, the dominant balance equation simplifies to:\n\n $ y''' = -\\frac{y}{3} + \\frac{1}{\\cos{(0)} - 3} = -\\frac{y}{3} + \\frac{1}{1 - 3} = -\\frac{y}{3} - \\frac{1}{2}$  \n\nThe initial conditions remain unchanged, and using these, we solve the differential equation to find an approximate solution for $ y(x)$  in the small $ x$  regime.\n\n### Large $ x$  Regime\nIn the large $ x$  regime, we focus on terms that dominate as $ x \\to \\infty$ . The  $ frac{1}{- 3 x^{4}}$  term from the last fraction will dominate the behavior in this regime. The differential equation simplifies to:\n\n $ y''' = - \\frac{y}{3} + y'^{2}$  \n\nThis simplification neglects terms that diminish as $ x$  increases and focuses on the leading behavior. We then look for a solution form that can satisfy this equation in the large $ x$  regime.\n\n### Analytical Solutions\n- **Small $ x$  Regime**: Given the simplified equation for small $ x$ , a trial solution method or a direct approach to solve the simplified third-order differential equation is needed.

The solution is thus $ $ y{\\left(x \\right)} = 1 - \\frac{x^{3}}{12}$ $  in the small x regime.\n\nThe solution for the large  $  x  $  regime uses an ansatz of the form \n$ $  y = \\alpha (x - x^*)^p, $ $  \nwhere  $  x^*  $  is the divergence point. Plugging in the ansatz and solving for the terms yields \n$ $ \n\\alpha p \\left(p - 2\\right) \\left(p - 1\\right) \\left(x - 9.39093909390939\\right)^{p - 3} = \\alpha^{2} p^{2} \\left(x - 9.39093909390939\\right)^{2 p - 2}\n$ $ \n\nAfter substituting the derivatives, the equation is reorganized to collect terms with respect to  $  (x - x^*)  $ . This leads to an equation where the coefficients and powers of  $  (x - x^*)  $  are equated on both sides. Simplifying the equation gives us two separate equations, one for the coefficients and another for the powers of  $  (x - x^*)  $ .\n\nThe coefficients' equation is:\n$ $ \n\\alpha p \\left(p - 2\\right) \\left(p - 1\\right) = \\alpha^{2} p^{2}\n$ $ \n\nThe powers' equation is:\n$ $ \np - 3 = 2 p - 2\n$ $ \n\nSolving this system of equations provides the values of  $  \\alpha  $  and  $  p  $ . \nA valid solution is identified if  $  \\alpha  $  and  $  p  $  are both nonzero. \nIn such a case, the solution for  $  \\alpha  $  and  $  p  $  is found to be:\n$ $ \n\\alpha = -6, \\quad p = -1\n$ $ \n\nWith these values, the integration constant  $  C  $  is determined by substituting \na known point from the numerical solution into the ansatz. This yields the following equation for  $  C  $ :\n$ $ \n61.2446961654432 = C + 66.6599999999993\n$ $ \n\nSolving this equation, we find the value of  $  C  $  to be:\n$ $ \nC = -5.4153038345561,\n$ $ \n\nso, the analytical approximation for the solution at large $ x$  (near the divergence point) is given by\n$ $ \ny = -6 (x - 9.39093909390939)^{-1} + (-5.4153038345561),\n$ $ \n\nand the analytical approximation for the solution at small $ x$  is given by\n$ $ \ny = 1 - \\frac{x^{3}}{12}.\n$ $ \n\nThus, the solution is given by \n$  $ boxed{[y = 1 - \\frac{x^{3}}{12}, y = -6 (x - 9.39093909390939)^{-1} + (-5.4153038345561)]}$ $ \n\n\n\nPlease grade the response based on the following criteria:\n\n You only need to take the analytical expression solutions for small and large x regimes in response and solution for comparison. This grade's final score should be between 0 to 1. You need to consider both the small and large x solutions. For each solution, if it  completely matches the elements in ground truth give full credit, give half credit if it gets partially correct and give no credit if it's completely wrong (a way tp determine is see whether the ground truth solution and the response have order of magnitude difference at given x regime).
