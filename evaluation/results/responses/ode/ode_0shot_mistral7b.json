Large x regime:\n   We'll assume that y(x) is a power series in 1/x and find the coefficients using the given differential equation.\n\n   ```python\n   large_x_expansion = []\n\n   for i in range(3):\n       large_x_expansion.append(y.subs(x, 1/epsilon).diff(x, i))\n\n   large_x_expansion += [y_prime.subs(x, 1/epsilon), y_double_prime.subs(x, 1/epsilon)]\n   ```\n\nNow we have two lists containing the Taylor series coefficients for small x and large x regimes:\n\n```python\nsmall_x_expansion = [y[0], y_prime[0], y_double_prime[0], y[1], y_prime[1], y_double_prime[1]]\nlarge_x_expansion = [y[i+3], y_prime[i+3], y_double_prime[i+3] for i in range(3)]\n```\n\nTo find the analytical expressions, we can use the given differential equation to solve for the coefficients. However, this is a complex problem that requires numerical methods or series solutions, which are beyond the scope of this platform. You may want to use a software like Mathematica or Maple to find the solutions or implement an iterative method in Python using SymPy or NumPy.\n\nThe final expressions will be in the form:\n\n $boxed{\\begin{bmatrix}\n\\text{small x coefficients expression} \\\\\n\\vdots \\\\\n\\text{large x coefficients expression}\n\\end{bmatrix}} $ \n\n and this ground truth         solution: The dominant balance in the small x regime is given by  $frac{d^{3}}{d x^{3}} y = e^{- x},$  and the dominant balance in the large x regime is given by  $frac{d^{3}}{d x^{3}} y = \\left(\\frac{d}{d x} y\\right)^{2}$ \nUsing the dominant balance in the small x regime, the solution can be derived by     setting $x=0$, analytically solving the dominant balance equation     for y, and plugging in the initial conditions. The solution is thus $ y{\\left(x \\right)} = \\frac{x^{3}}{6} + 1$  in the small x regime.\n\nThe solution for the large  $ x  $ regime uses an ansatz of the form \n$  y = \\alpha (x - x^*)^p, $  \nwhere  $ x^*  $ is the divergence point. Plugging in the ansatz and solving for the terms yields \n$ \n\\alpha p \\left(p - 2\\right) \\left(p - 1\\right) \\left(x - 4.98049804980498\\right)^{p - 3} = \\alpha^{2} p^{2} \\left(x - 4.98049804980498\\right)^{2 p - 2}\n$ \n\nAfter substituting the derivatives, the equation is reorganized to collect terms with respect to  $ (x - x^*)  $. This leads to an equation where the coefficients and powers of  $ (x - x^*)  $ are equated on both sides. Simplifying the equation gives us two separate equations, one for the coefficients and another for the powers of  $ (x - x^*)  $.\n\nThe coefficients' equation is:\n$ \n\\alpha p \\left(p - 2\\right) \\left(p - 1\\right) = \\alpha^{2} p^{2}\n$ \n\nThe powers' equation is:\n$ \np - 3 = 2 p - 2\n$ \n\nSolving this system of equations provides the values of  $ \\alpha  $ and  $ p  $. \nA valid solution is identified if  $ \\alpha  $ and  $ p  $ are both nonzero. \nIn such a case, the solution for  $ \\alpha  $ and  $ p  $ is found to be:\n$ \n\\alpha = -6, \\quad p = -1\n$ \n\nWith these values, the integration constant  $ C  $ is determined by substituting \na known point from the numerical solution into the ansatz. This yields the following equation for  $ C  $:\n$ \n59.6013169597106 = C + 66.66\n$ \n\nSolving this equation, we find the value of  $ C  $ to be:\n$ \nC = -7.0586830402894,\n$ \n\nso, the analytical approximation for the solution at large $x$ (near the divergence point) is given by\n$ \ny = -6 (x - 4.98049804980498)^{-1} + (-7.0586830402894),\n$ \n\nand the analytical approximation for the solution at small $x$ is given by\n$ \ny = \\frac{x^{3}}{6} + 1.\n$ \n\nThus, the solution is given by \n $boxed{[y = \\frac{x^{3}}{6} + 1, y = -6 (x - 4.98049804980498)^{-1} + (-7.0586830402894)]}$ \n\n and grade the response based on the following criteria:\n\n1) Check both the small and large $\\epsilon$ solutions.         2) For each solution, give full credit if it matches the formula in the answer key;         give no credit if it is completely wrong and briefly state the reason for the error.         3) Average the scores for the small and large epsilon solutions to obtain a final score between 0 and 1.         4) Give the final grading as a float in Latex boxed format \\[boxed{}\\]",

However, due to the complexity of the function terms and lack of specific information about the large `x` behavior, you'll need to find suitable approximations for each term in the function `f`.\n\nThe final output will be a list containing the variable `\u03b5` and math operation expressions for both small and large `x` regimes:\n\n```python\n# Combine Taylor series expansion for small x and power series expansion for large x\napproximations = [\n    r\"boxed{\\epsilon^{3}}\",\n    r\"boxed{\\frac{1}{\\epsilon}}\"\n] + [large_x_series.subs(*coefficients)]\n```\n\n and this ground truth         solution: The dominant balance in the small x regime is given by  $frac{d^{3}}{d x^{3}} y = - \\frac{y}{12 x^{4} + 20 x^{3} + 4},$  and the dominant balance in the large x regime is given by  $frac{d^{3}}{d x^{3}} y = \\left(\\frac{d}{d x} y\\right)^{4}$ \nUsing the dominant balance in the small x regime, the solution can be derived by     setting $x=0$, analytically solving the dominant balance equation     for y, and plugging in the initial conditions. The solution is thus $ y{\\left(x \\right)} = 1 - \\frac{x^{3}}{24}$  in the small x regime.\n\nThe solution for the large  $ x  $ regime uses an ansatz of the form \n$  y = \\alpha (x - x^*)^p, $  \nwhere  $ x^*  $ is the divergence point. Plugging in the ansatz and solving for the terms yields \n$ \n\\alpha p \\left(p - 2\\right) \\left(p - 1\\right) \\left(x - 22.2022202220222\\right)^{p - 3} = \\alpha^{4} p^{4} \\left(x - 22.2022202220222\\right)^{4 p - 4}\n$ \n\nAfter substituting the derivatives, the equation is reorganized to collect terms with respect to  $ (x - x^*)  $. This leads to an equation where the coefficients and powers of  $ (x - x^*)  $ are equated on both sides. Simplifying the equation gives us two separate equations, one for the coefficients and another for the powers of  $ (x - x^*)  $.\n\nThe coefficients' equation is:\n$ \n\\alpha p \\left(p - 2\\right) \\left(p - 1\\right) = \\alpha^{4} p^{4}\n$ \n\nThe powers' equation is:\n$ \np - 3 = 4 p - 4\n$ \n\nSolving this system of equations provides the values of  $ \\alpha  $ and  $ p  $. \nA valid solution is identified if  $ \\alpha  $ and  $ p  $ are both nonzero. \nIn such a case, the solution for  $ \\alpha  $ and  $ p  $ is found to be:\n$ \n\\alpha = \\sqrt[3]{30}, \\quad p = \\frac{1}{3}\n$ \n\nWith these values, the integration constant  $ C  $ is determined by substituting \na known point from the numerical solution into the ansatz. This yields the following equation for  $ C  $:\n$ \n1.80575563526414 = C - 0.448155413667482 \\cdot \\sqrt[3]{30}\n$ \n\nSolving this equation, we find the value of  $ C  $ to be:\n$ \nC = 3.19827870433094,\n$ \n\nso, the analytical approximation for the solution at large $x$ (near the divergence point) is given by\n$ \ny = \\sqrt[3]{30} (x - 22.2022202220222)^{\\frac{1}{3}} + (3.19827870433094),\n$ \n\nand the analytical approximation for the solution at small $x$ is given by\n$ \ny = 1 - \\frac{x^{3}}{24}.\n$ \n\nThus, the solution is given by \n $boxed{[y = 1 - \\frac{x^{3}}{24}, y = \\sqrt[3]{30} (x - 22.2022202220222)^{\\frac{1}{3}} + (3.19827870433094)]}$ \n\n and grade the response based on the following criteria:\n\n1) Check both the small and large $\\epsilon$ solutions.         2) For each solution, give full credit if it matches the formula in the answer key;         give no credit if it is completely wrong and briefly state the reason for the error.         3) Average the scores for the small and large epsilon solutions to obtain a final score between 0 and 1.         4) Give the final grading as a float in Latex boxed format \\[boxed{}\\]",

Find y'(0), y''(0), and y'''(0) using the given initial conditions:\n   y'(0) = 0\n   y''(0) = 0\n   y'''(0) = -1/8\n\n2. Substitute these values into the Taylor series expansion:\n   y(x) \u2248 1 + (-1/8) * x^3 + ...\n\nLarge x regime (Asymptotic expansion):\n\n1. Find the dominant terms in the differential equation for large x:\n   - The term with the highest power of x is 1/(6x^2 - 3x + sin(x) - 5), which can be approximated as 1/6x^2 for large x.\n   - The other terms are y/8x^2, y'^4, and y''/(3x^4-7). These terms will be relatively small compared to the dominant term for large x.\n\n2. Assume a form of y(x) as A * e^(f(x)):\n   f'(x) = -y(x)/(8x^2 + 3) + y'(x)^4 - y''(x)/(3x^4-7) + 1/(6x^2 - 3x + sin(x) - 5)\n\n3. For large x, we can approximate f'(x) as:\n   f'(x) \u2248 -A/6x^2 + A^4*y'(x)^4 - A*(3x^4-7)^(-1)*y''(x) + O(1/x^3)\n\n4. Since we don't have explicit expressions for y'(x) and y''(x), we can't find an exact solution for the large x regime. However, we can find an approximate solution by assuming that y'(x) and y''(x) are constants (C1 and C2 respectively).\n\n5. With this assumption, we get:\n   f'(x) \u2248 -A/6x^2 + A^4*C1^4 - A*(3x^4-7)^(-1)*C2 + O(1/x^3)\n\n6. Integrating both sides with respect to x, we get:\n   f(x) \u2248 -A/3x + (1/4) * A^4*C1^4*x^4 - (1/8) * A*(3x^4-7)^(-2)*C2*x^5 + O(1/x^2)\n\n7. Now we can find an approximate expression for y(x):\n   y(x) \u2248 A * e^(f(x)) \u2248 A * e^(-A/3x) * e^((1/4) * A^4*C1^4*x^4 - (1/8) * A*(3x^4-7)^(-2)*C2*x^5 + O(1/x^2))\n\nNow, let's find the SymPy expressions for each regime:\n\nSmall x regime:\ny_small(x) = sympy.Taylor(sympy.Function('y')(x), x, 0, 3)[2]\ny_small(x) = -1/8 * x**3 + y(0)\n\nLarge x regime (assuming y'(x) and y''(x) are constants C1 and C2):\ny_large(x) = sympy.exp(-sympy.Function('A')(x)/(3*x)) * sympy.exp((1/4)*sympy.Function('A')(x)**4*C1**4*x**4 - (1/8)*sympy.Function('A')(x)*(3*x**4-7)**(-2)*C2*x**5)\n\nThe final lists in LaTeX format are:\n\n $boxed{\\begin{bmatrix} \\epsilon^{3}, \\\\ y_small(x) = -1/8 * x^3 + 1 \\end{bmatrix}}$ \n\nand\n\n $boxed{\\begin{bmatrix} 1/\\epsilon, \\\\ y_large(x) = A(x) * e^{-A(x)/(3*x)} * e^{(1/4)*A(x)^4*C1^4*x^4 - (1/8)*A(x)*(3*x^4-7)^{(-2)}*C2*x^5} \\end{bmatrix}}$ \n\nNote that A(x) is a function of x, and C1 and C2 are constants to be determined by matching the approximations with the exact solution or numerical methods.\n\n and this ground truth         solution: The dominant balance in the small x regime is given by  $frac{d^{3}}{d x^{3}} y = - \\frac{y}{8 x^{2} + 3},$  and the dominant balance in the large x regime is given by  $frac{d^{3}}{d x^{3}} y = \\left(\\frac{d}{d x} y\\right)^{4}$ \nUsing the dominant balance in the small x regime, the solution can be derived by     setting $x=0$, analytically solving the dominant balance equation     for y, and plugging in the initial conditions. The solution is thus $ y{\\left(x \\right)} = 1 - \\frac{x^{3}}{18}$  in the small x regime.\n\nThe solution for the large  $ x  $ regime uses an ansatz of the form \n$  y = \\alpha (x - x^*)^p, $  \nwhere  $ x^*  $ is the divergence point. Plugging in the ansatz and solving for the terms yields \n$ \n\\alpha p \\left(p - 2\\right) \\left(p - 1\\right) \\left(x - 10.5610561056106\\right)^{p - 3} = \\alpha^{4} p^{4} \\left(x - 10.5610561056106\\right)^{4 p - 4}\n$ \n\nAfter substituting the derivatives, the equation is reorganized to collect terms with respect to  $ (x - x^*)  $. This leads to an equation where the coefficients and powers of  $ (x - x^*)  $ are equated on both sides. Simplifying the equation gives us two separate equations, one for the coefficients and another for the powers of  $ (x - x^*)  $.\n\nThe coefficients' equation is:\n$ \n\\alpha p \\left(p - 2\\right) \\left(p - 1\\right) = \\alpha^{4} p^{4}\n$ \n\nThe powers' equation is:\n$ \np - 3 = 4 p - 4\n$ \n\nSolving this system of equations provides the values of  $ \\alpha  $ and  $ p  $. \nA valid solution is identified if  $ \\alpha  $ and  $ p  $ are both nonzero. \nIn such a case, the solution for  $ \\alpha  $ and  $ p  $ is found to be:\n$ \n\\alpha = \\sqrt[3]{30}, \\quad p = \\frac{1}{3}\n$ \n\nWith these values, the integration constant  $ C  $ is determined by substituting \na known point from the numerical solution into the ansatz.

Plugging in the ansatz and solving for the terms yields \n$ \n\\alpha p \\left(p - 2\\right) \\left(p - 1\\right) \\left(x - 3.12031203120312\\right)^{p - 3} = \\alpha^{4} p^{4} \\left(x - 3.12031203120312\\right)^{4 p - 4}\n$ \n\nAfter substituting the derivatives, the equation is reorganized to collect terms with respect to  $ (x - x^*)  $. This leads to an equation where the coefficients and powers of  $ (x - x^*)  $ are equated on both sides. Simplifying the equation gives us two separate equations, one for the coefficients and another for the powers of  $ (x - x^*)  $.\n\nThe coefficients' equation is:\n$ \n\\alpha p \\left(p - 2\\right) \\left(p - 1\\right) = \\alpha^{4} p^{4}\n$ \n\nThe powers' equation is:\n$ \np - 3 = 4 p - 4\n$ \n\nSolving this system of equations provides the values of  $ \\alpha  $ and  $ p  $. \nA valid solution is identified if  $ \\alpha  $ and  $ p  $ are both nonzero. \nIn such a case, the solution for  $ \\alpha  $ and  $ p  $ is found to be:\n$ \n\\alpha = \\sqrt[3]{30}, \\quad p = \\frac{1}{3}\n$ \n\nWith these values, the integration constant  $ C  $ is determined by substituting \na known point from the numerical solution into the ansatz. This yields the following equation for  $ C  $:\n$ \n3.20103398186673 = C - 0.448155413667484 \\cdot \\sqrt[3]{30}\n$ \n\nSolving this equation, we find the value of  $ C  $ to be:\n$ \nC = 4.59355705093353,\n$ \n\nso, the analytical approximation for the solution at large $x$ (near the divergence point) is given by\n$ \ny = \\sqrt[3]{30} (x - 3.12031203120312)^{\\frac{1}{3}} + (4.59355705093353),\n$ \n\nand the analytical approximation for the solution at small $x$ is given by\n$ \ny = 1 - \\frac{x^{3}}{6}.\n$ \n\nThus, the solution is given by \n $boxed{[y = 1 - \\frac{x^{3}}{6}, y = \\sqrt[3]{30} (x - 3.12031203120312)^{\\frac{1}{3}} + (4.59355705093353)]}$ \n\n and grade the response based on the following criteria:\n\n1) Check both the small and large $\\epsilon$ solutions.         2) For each solution, give full credit if it matches the formula in the answer key;         give no credit if it is completely wrong and briefly state the reason for the error.         3) Average the scores for the small and large epsilon solutions to obtain a final score between 0 and 1.         4) Give the final grading as a float in Latex boxed format \\[boxed{}\\]",
