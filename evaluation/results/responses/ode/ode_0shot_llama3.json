This suggests that the solution will behave like a power series in $ x$ . We can expand the denominator as:\n\n$  $ cos(x) - 2 = -(x^2 + \\mathcal{O}(x^4)),$ $ where  $ mathcal{O}(x^4)$  represents terms of order $ x^4$  and higher. The inverse cosine function can then be approximated by:\n\n$  $ frac{1}{\\cos(x) - 2} \\approx \\frac{-1}{-x^2 + \\mathcal{O}(x^4)} = \\frac{1}{x^2 + \\mathcal{O}(x^4)}.$ $ \n\nSubstituting this approximation into the original differential equation, we get:\n\n$ $ y''' \\approx -\\frac{y}{15 x^3 - 4} + y'^4 - \\frac{y''}{20 x^3 + 30} + \\frac{1}{x^2 + \\mathcal{O}(x^4)}.$ $ \n\nUsing the initial conditions, we can simplify this expression to:\n\n$ $ y''' \\approx -\\frac{y}{15 x^3 - 4} + y'^4 + \\frac{1}{x^2}.$ $ \n\nThis is a third-order linear differential equation in $ y$  and its derivatives. We can use the initial conditions to find an approximate solution in terms of power series:\n\n$ $ y(x) \\approx 1 - x^3.$ $ This expression approximates the solution for small values of $ x$ .\n\n**Large-$ x$  regime**\n\nAs $ x\\to\\infty$ , the term  $ frac{1}{\\cos(x)-2}$  becomes negligible due to its oscillatory behavior. The other terms in the differential equation will dominate, and we can approximate the solution as:\n\n$ $ y''' \\approx -\\frac{y}{15 x^3 - 4} + y'^4.$ $ \n\nUsing the initial conditions, this simplifies to:\n\n$ $ y'' = C_1 e^{-x/5} + C_2 e^{x/5},$ $ where $ C_1$  and $ C_2$  are constants that can be determined from the initial conditions.\n\nThe general solution for large values of $ x$  is then:\n\n$ $ y(x) \\approx -\\frac{6}{x-5}.$ $ This expression approximates the solution for large values of $ x$ .\n\n**Final answer**\n\nThe analytical expressions that approximate the solution of $ y(x)$  in the small-$ x$  and large-$ x$  regimes are:\n\n$ $ [y = 1 - x^{3}, y = -6/(x-5)]$ $ \n\nThis is expressed as a LaTeX boxed list:\n\\boxed{[y = 1 - x^{3}, y = -6/(x-5)]}\n\n and this ground truth solution: The dominant balance in the small x regime is given by $  $ frac{d^{3}}{d x^{3}} y = - \\frac{y}{24 x^{4} + 6 x^{2} + 3},$ $  and the dominant balance in the large x regime is given by $  $ frac{d^{3}}{d x^{3}} y = \\left(\\frac{d}{d x} y\\right)^{2}$ $ \nUsing the dominant balance in the small x regime, the solution can be derived by     setting $ x=0$ , analytically solving the dominant balance equation     for y, and plugging in the initial conditions. The solution is thus $ $ y{\\left(x \\right)} = 1 - \\frac{x^{3}}{18}$ $  in the small x regime.\n\nThe solution for the large  $  x  $  regime uses an ansatz of the form \n$ $  y = \\alpha (x - x^*)^p, $ $  \nwhere  $  x^*  $  is the divergence point. Plugging in the ansatz and solving for the terms yields \n$ $ \n\\alpha p \\left(p - 2\\right) \\left(p - 1\\right) \\left(x - 11.4511451145115\\right)^{p - 3} = \\alpha^{2} p^{2} \\left(x - 11.4511451145115\\right)^{2 p - 2}\n$ $ \n\nAfter substituting the derivatives, the equation is reorganized to collect terms with respect to  $  (x - x^*)  $ .

This gives us:\n\n$  $ frac{d^3y}{dx^3} \\approx 0$ $ \n\nThis is a homogeneous third-order differential equation with constant coefficients. The general solution to this equation is given by:\n\n$ $ y(x) = A_1 x + A_2 x^2 + A_3 x^3 + C_1 e^{-x} + C_2 e^{x}$ $ \n\nwhere $ A_1, A_2, A_3, C_1$ , and $ C_2$  are constants. However, since we know that $ y(0) = 1$ , we can set $ x=0$  in the above expression to get:\n\n$ $ 1 = A_1 (0) + A_2 (0)^2 + A_3 (0)^3 + C_1 e^{0} + C_2 e^0 \\Rightarrow 1 = C_1 + C_2$ $ \n\nAlso, since $ y'(0)=0$ , we can set the derivative of the above expression to zero at $ x=0$ :\n\n$ $ 0 = A_1 + 2A_2 + 3A_3 + C_1 e^0 + C_2 e^0 \\Rightarrow 0 = A_1 + 2A_2 + 3A_3 + (C_1+C_2)$ $ \n\nSubstituting $ C_1+C_2=1$ , we get:\n\n$ $ 0 = A_1 + 2A_2 + 3A_3 + 1 \\Rightarrow -1 = A_1 + 2A_2 + 3A_3$ $ \n\nSolving this system of equations, we find that $ A_1=A_2=A_3=0$  and $ C_1+C_2=1$ . This means that the solution in the small $ x$  regime is given by:\n\n$ $ y(x) = C_1 e^{-x} + C_2 e^x \\approx 1 - x^3$ $ \n\nIn the large $ x$  regime ($ x\\to\\infty$ ), we have:\n\n$ $ y''' = - \\frac{y}{16 x + 5} + y'^{4} + \\frac{y''}{- 20 x^{2} + 4 x + 17} + \\frac{1}{12 x^{3} + \\cos{\\left(x \\right)} - 3}\\approx0+y'^{4}+0$ $ \n\nSince $ x$  is large, the term  $ frac{y}{16 x + 5}$  is small compared to the other terms. Therefore, we can ignore this term and treat it as a perturbation.\n\nThis gives us:\n\n$  $ frac{d^3y}{dx^3} \\approx y'^4$ $ \n\nThis is a first-order differential equation with respect to $ x$ . The general solution to this equation is given by:\n\n$ $ y(x) = A e^{-x} + B x + C$ $ \n\nwhere $ A, B$ , and $ C$  are constants. However, since we know that $ y(\\infty)=0$ , we can set $ x=\\infty$  in the above expression to get:\n\n$ $ 0 = Ae^{-\\infty} + B \\infty + C \\Rightarrow 0 = C$ $ \n\nAlso, since $ y'(\\infty)=0$ , we can set the derivative of the above expression to zero at $ x=\\infty$ :\n\n$ $ 0 = -Ae^{-\\infty} + B \\Rightarrow 0 = B$ $ \n\nSubstituting these values back into the original expression for $ y(x)$ , we get:\n\n$ $ y(x) = Ae^{-x}$ $ \n\nHowever, since we also know that $ y(0)=1$ , we can set $ x=0$  in the above expression to get:\n\n$ $ 1 = Ae^0 \\Rightarrow 1=A$ $ \n\nThis gives us the solution in the large $ x$  regime as:\n\n$ $ y(x) = e^{-x}$ $ \n\nTherefore, the analytical expressions that approximate the solution of $ y(x)$  in the small $ x$  and large $ x$  regimes are given by:\n\n\\boxed{[y = 1 - x^{3}, y = -e^{-x}]}\n\nNote that these expressions are not exact solutions to the differential equation, but rather asymptotic approximations. The actual solution may differ from these expressions in certain regions of the $ x$ -axis.\n\n and this ground truth solution: The dominant balance in the small x regime is given by $  $ frac{d^{3}}{d x^{3}} y = - \\frac{y}{24 x^{4} + 6 x^{2} + 3},$ $  and the dominant balance in the large x regime is given by $  $ frac{d^{3}}{d x^{3}} y = \\left(\\frac{d}{d x} y\\right)^{2}$ $ \nUsing the dominant balance in the small x regime, the solution can be derived by     setting $ x=0$ , analytically solving the dominant balance equation     for y, and plugging in the initial conditions. The solution is thus $ $ y{\\left(x \\right)} = 1 - \\frac{x^{3}}{18}$ $  in the small x regime.\n\nThe solution for the large  $  x  $  regime uses an ansatz of the form \n$ $  y = \\alpha (x - x^*)^p, $ $  \nwhere  $  x^*  $  is the divergence point. Plugging in the ansatz and solving for the terms yields \n$ $ \n\\alpha p \\left(p - 2\\right) \\left(p - 1\\right) \\left(x - 11.4511451145115\\right)^{p - 3} = \\alpha^{2} p^{2} \\left(x - 11.4511451145115\\right)^{2 p - 2}\n$ $ \n\nAfter substituting the derivatives, the equation is reorganized to collect terms with respect to  $  (x - x^*)  $ . This leads to an equation where the coefficients and powers of  $  (x - x^*)  $  are equated on both sides. Simplifying the equation gives us two separate equations, one for the coefficients and another for the powers of  $  (x - x^*)  $ .\n\nThe coefficients' equation is:\n$ $ \n\\alpha p \\left(p - 2\\right) \\left(p - 1\\right) = \\alpha^{2} p^{2}\n$ $ \n\nThe powers' equation is:\n$ $ \np - 3 = 2 p - 2\n$ $ \n\nSolving this system of equations provides the values of  $  \\alpha  $  and  $  p  $ . \nA valid solution is identified if  $  \\alpha  $  and  $  p  $  are both nonzero. \nIn such a case, the solution for  $  \\alpha  $  and  $  p  $  is found to be:\n$ $ \n\\alpha = -6, \\quad p = -1\n$ $ \n\nWith these values, the integration constant  $  C  $  is determined by substituting \na known point from the numerical solution into the ansatz.
