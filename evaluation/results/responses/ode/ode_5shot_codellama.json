For each solution, if it  completely matches the elements in ground truth give full credit, give half credit if it gets partially correct and give no credit if it's completely wrong (a way tp determine is see whether the ground truth solution and the response have order of magnitude difference at given x regime).

For each solution, if it  completely matches the elements in ground truth give full credit, give half credit if it gets partially correct and give no credit if it's completely wrong (a way tp determine is see whether the ground truth solution and the response have order of magnitude difference at given x regime).

Since the coefficients are different, the solutions are not completely correct but are of the same order of magnitude.

For each solution, if it  completely matches the elements in ground truth give full credit, give half credit if it gets partially correct and give no credit if it's completely wrong (a way tp determine is see whether the ground truth solution and the response have order of magnitude difference at given x regime).
