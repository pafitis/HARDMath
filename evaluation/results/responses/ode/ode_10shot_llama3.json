The coefficient of \\( \\frac{x^3}{6} \\) is incorrect. Therefore, no credit is given for the small \\( x \\) regime solution.\n\n### Large \\( x \\) Regime Solution\n\n**Response:**\n\\[ y = \\sqrt[3]{6}(x-4)^{\\frac{1}{3}} + 2.25 \\]\n\n**Ground Truth:**\n\\[ y = -6 (x - 9.39093909390939)^{-1} + (-5.4153038345561) \\]\n\nThe response does not match the ground truth solution. The form of the solution and the values of the parameters \\( \\alpha \\) and \\( p \\) are incorrect. Therefore, no credit is given for the large \\( x \\) regime solution.\n\n### Final Score Calculation\n\nSince both the small and large \\( x \\) regime solutions are completely wrong, the scores for both are 0.\n\n\\[ \\text{Final Score} = \\frac{0 + 0}{2} = 0 \\]\n\n### Final Grading\n\n\\[ \\boxed{0} \\]",
