The solution is thus $ y{\\left(x \\right)} = 1 - \\frac{x^{3}}{12}$  in the small x regime.\n\nThe solution for the large  $ x  $ regime uses an ansatz of the form \n$  y = \\alpha (x - x^*)^p, $  \nwhere  $ x^*  $ is the divergence point. Plugging in the ansatz and solving for the terms yields \n$ \n\\alpha p \\left(p - 2\\right) \\left(p - 1\\right) \\left(x - 9.39093909390939\\right)^{p - 3} = \\alpha^{2} p^{2} \\left(x - 9.39093909390939\\right)^{2 p - 2}\n$ \n\nAfter substituting the derivatives, the equation is reorganized to collect terms with respect to  $ (x - x^*)  $. This leads to an equation where the coefficients and powers of  $ (x - x^*)  $ are equated on both sides. Simplifying the equation gives us two separate equations, one for the coefficients and another for the powers of  $ (x - x^*)  $.\n\nThe coefficients' equation is:\n$ \n\\alpha p \\left(p - 2\\right) \\left(p - 1\\right) = \\alpha^{2} p^{2}\n$ \n\nThe powers' equation is:\n$ \np - 3 = 2 p - 2\n$ \n\nSolving this system of equations provides the values of  $ \\alpha  $ and  $ p  $. \nA valid solution is identified if  $ \\alpha  $ and  $ p  $ are both nonzero. \nIn such a case, the solution for  $ \\alpha  $ and  $ p  $ is found to be:\n$ \n\\alpha = -6, \\quad p = -1\n$ \n\nWith these values, the integration constant  $ C  $ is determined by substituting \na known point from the numerical solution into the ansatz. This yields the following equation for  $ C  $:\n$ \n61.2446961654432 = C + 66.6599999999993\n$ \n\nSolving this equation, we find the value of  $ C  $ to be:\n$ \nC = -5.4153038345561,\n$ \n\nso, the analytical approximation for the solution at large $x$ (near the divergence point) is given by\n$ \ny = -6 (x - 9.39093909390939)^{-1} + (-5.4153038345561),\n$ \n\nand the analytical approximation for the solution at small $x$ is given by\n$ \ny = 1 - \\frac{x^{3}}{12}.\n$ \n\nThus, the solution is given by \n $boxed{[y = 1 - \\frac{x^{3}}{12}, y = -6 (x - 9.39093909390939)^{-1} + (-5.4153038345561)]}$ \n\n and grade the response based on the following criteria:\n\n1) Check both the small and large $\\epsilon$ solutions.         2) For small regime solution, only give full credit if it matches the formula in the answer key exactly;         give no credit if it is doesn't match the form.
