We can approximate the given differential equation by neglecting higher-order terms in  $ x $ .\n\nLet's nondimensionalize the equation by introducing a small parameter   $ epsilon $  such that  $ x = \\epsilon X $ ,  $ y = \\epsilon^a Y $ , and differentiate with respect to  $ X $ .\n\nSubstitute these expressions into the given differential equation, neglect higher-order terms, and solve for  $ a $  to find the dominant balance.\n\nThe dominant balance solution in the small  $ x $  regime will be in the form of  $ Y \\sim X^n $ , where  $ n $  is determined by the dominant balance.\n\n**Large x regime:**\n\nIn the large  $ x $  regime, we are interested in the behavior of the solution as  $ x \\rightarrow \\infty $ .
