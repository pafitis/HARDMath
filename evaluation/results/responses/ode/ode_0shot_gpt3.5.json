The simplified ODE becomes:\n$ y''' = - \\frac{y}{-2x^{4}}$ \nwith initial conditions:\n $\ny(0) &= 1.00 \\\\\ny'(0) &= 0.00 \\\\\ny''(0) &= 0.00\n$\n\nSolving this simplified ODE with the initial conditions gives an approximate solution in the large $x$ regime.\n\nLet's find the analytical expressions for the approximate solutions in both regimes.\n\n and this ground truth         solution: The dominant balance in the small x regime is given by  $frac{d^{3}}{d x^{3}} y = \\frac{1}{- 2 x^{4} + 4 x^{2} + 4 x + \\sin{\\left(x \\right)} - 3},$  and the dominant balance in the large x regime is given by  $frac{d^{3}}{d x^{3}} y = \\left(\\frac{d}{d x} y\\right)^{4}$ \nUsing the dominant balance in the small x regime, the solution can be derived by     setting $x=0$, analytically solving the dominant balance equation     for y, and plugging in the initial conditions. The solution is thus $ y{\\left(x \\right)} = 1 - \\frac{x^{3}}{18}$  in the small x regime.\n\nThe solution for the large  $ x  $ regime uses an ansatz of the form \n$  y = \\alpha (x - x^*)^p, $  \nwhere  $ x^*  $ is the divergence point. Plugging in the ansatz and solving for the terms yields \n$ \n\\alpha p \\left(p - 2\\right) \\left(p - 1\\right) \\left(x - 3.98039803980398\\right)^{p - 3} = \\alpha^{4} p^{4} \\left(x - 3.98039803980398\\right)^{4 p - 4}\n$ \n\nAfter substituting the derivatives, the equation is reorganized to collect terms with respect to  $ (x - x^*)  $. This leads to an equation where the coefficients and powers of  $ (x - x^*)  $ are equated on both sides. Simplifying the equation gives us two separate equations, one for the coefficients and another for the powers of  $ (x - x^*)  $.\n\nThe coefficients' equation is:\n$ \n\\alpha p \\left(p - 2\\right) \\left(p - 1\\right) = \\alpha^{4} p^{4}\n$ \n\nThe powers' equation is:\n$ \np - 3 = 4 p - 4\n$ \n\nSolving this system of equations provides the values of  $ \\alpha  $ and  $ p  $. \nA valid solution is identified if  $ \\alpha  $ and  $ p  $ are both nonzero. \nIn such a case, the solution for  $ \\alpha  $ and  $ p  $ is found to be:\n$ \n\\alpha = \\sqrt[3]{30}, \\quad p = \\frac{1}{3}\n$ \n\nWith these values, the integration constant  $ C  $ is determined by substituting \na known point from the numerical solution into the ansatz.

The leading order terms in the equation are:\n$ y''' = \\frac{y}{15x^4} + y'^{4} + \\frac{y''}{8x^4}$ \nSolving this simplified equation will give us an approximate solution for the large $x$ regime.\n\nTherefore, the analytical expressions that approximate the solution of $y(x)$ in the small $x$ and large $x$ regimes are:\n  $boxed{[y = -2x^{3} + x^{4}, y = 15x^{4} - 8x^{3} + 4x^{2}]}$ \n\n and this ground truth         solution: The dominant balance in the small x regime is given by  $frac{d^{3}}{d x^{3}} y = \\frac{1}{4 x^{2} + \\cos{\\left(x \\right)} - 4},$  and the dominant balance in the large x regime is given by  $frac{d^{3}}{d x^{3}} y = \\left(\\frac{d}{d x} y\\right)^{4}$ \nUsing the dominant balance in the small x regime, the solution can be derived by     setting $x=0$, analytically solving the dominant balance equation     for y, and plugging in the initial conditions. The solution is thus $ y{\\left(x \\right)} = 1 - \\frac{x^{3}}{18}$  in the small x regime.\n\nThe solution for the large  $ x  $ regime uses an ansatz of the form \n$  y = \\alpha (x - x^*)^p, $  \nwhere  $ x^*  $ is the divergence point. Plugging in the ansatz and solving for the terms yields \n$ \n\\alpha p \\left(p - 2\\right) \\left(p - 1\\right) \\left(x - 12.021202120212\\right)^{p - 3} = \\alpha^{4} p^{4} \\left(x - 12.021202120212\\right)^{4 p - 4}\n$ \n\nAfter substituting the derivatives, the equation is reorganized to collect terms with respect to  $ (x - x^*)  $. This leads to an equation where the coefficients and powers of  $ (x - x^*)  $ are equated on both sides. Simplifying the equation gives us two separate equations, one for the coefficients and another for the powers of  $ (x - x^*)  $.\n\nThe coefficients' equation is:\n$ \n\\alpha p \\left(p - 2\\right) \\left(p - 1\\right) = \\alpha^{4} p^{4}\n$ \n\nThe powers' equation is:\n$ \np - 3 = 4 p - 4\n$ \n\nSolving this system of equations provides the values of  $ \\alpha  $ and  $ p  $. \nA valid solution is identified if  $ \\alpha  $ and  $ p  $ are both nonzero. \nIn such a case, the solution for  $ \\alpha  $ and  $ p  $ is found to be:\n$ \n\\alpha = \\sqrt[3]{30}, \\quad p = \\frac{1}{3}\n$ \n\nWith these values, the integration constant  $ C  $ is determined by substituting \na known point from the numerical solution into the ansatz.
