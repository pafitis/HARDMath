The solution is thus $ y{\\left(x \\right)} = 1 - \\frac{x^{3}}{18}$  in the small x regime.\n\nThe solution for the large  $ x  $ regime uses an ansatz of the form \n$  y = \\alpha (x - x^*)^p, $  \nwhere  $ x^*  $ is the divergence point.

This leads to an equation where the coefficients and powers of  $ (x - x^*)  $ are equated on both sides. Simplifying the equation gives us two separate equations, one for the coefficients and another for the powers of  $ (x - x^*)  $.\n\nThe coefficients' equation is:\n$ \n\\alpha p \\left(p - 2\\right) \\left(p - 1\\right) = \\alpha^{2} p^{2}\n$ \n\nThe powers' equation is:\n$ \np - 3 = 2 p - 2\n$ \n\nSolving this system of equations provides the values of  $ \\alpha  $ and  $ p  $. \nA valid solution is identified if  $ \\alpha  $ and  $ p  $ are both nonzero. \nIn such a case, the solution for  $ \\alpha  $ and  $ p  $ is found to be:\n$ \n\\alpha = -6, \\quad p = -1\n$ \n\nWith these values, the integration constant  $ C  $ is determined by substituting \na known point from the numerical solution into the ansatz.

As  $x \\to \\infty $, the terms  $15x^3 $ and  $20x^3 $ dominate the denominators, so:\n $ y''' \\approx -\\frac{y}{15x^3} - \\frac{y''}{20x^3} $ \n\nAssuming  $y $ and its derivatives do not grow faster than polynomially, the terms involving  $y $ and  $y'' $ become negligible as  $x \\to \\infty $. The dominant term then is:\n $ y''' \\approx \\frac{1}{\\cos(x) - 2} $ \n\nSince   $cos(x) $ oscillates between -1 and 1,   $cos(x) - 2 $ oscillates between -3 and -1, making the term   $frac{1}{\\cos(x) - 2} $ bounded and oscillatory. We can approximate  $y(x) $ as a slowly varying function for large  $x $, possibly tending towards a constant or a slowly varying oscillatory function. A simple approximation might be:\n $ y(x) \\approx \\text{constant} $ \n\nGiven the complexity and the behavior at infinity, a more detailed analysis would be required for a precise form, but for an approximation:\n $ y(x) \\approx 1 $ \n\n### Final Answer\n $\n\\boxed{[y = 1 - \\frac{x^3}{8}, y = 1]}\n$ \n\n and this ground truth         solution: The dominant balance in the small x regime is given by  $frac{d^{3}}{d x^{3}} y = \\frac{1}{\\cos{\\left(x \\right)} - 2},$  and the dominant balance in the large x regime is given by  $frac{d^{3}}{d x^{3}} y = \\left(\\frac{d}{d x} y\\right)^{4}$ \nUsing the dominant balance in the small x regime, the solution can be derived by     setting $x=0$, analytically solving the dominant balance equation     for y, and plugging in the initial conditions. The solution is thus $ y{\\left(x \\right)} = 1 - \\frac{x^{3}}{6}$  in the small x regime.\n\nThe solution for the large  $ x  $ regime uses an ansatz of the form \n$  y = \\alpha (x - x^*)^p, $  \nwhere  $ x^*  $ is the divergence point. Plugging in the ansatz and solving for the terms yields \n$ \n\\alpha p \\left(p - 2\\right) \\left(p - 1\\right) \\left(x - 7.14071407140714\\right)^{p - 3} = \\alpha^{4} p^{4} \\left(x - 7.14071407140714\\right)^{4 p - 4}\n$ \n\nAfter substituting the derivatives, the equation is reorganized to collect terms with respect to  $ (x - x^*)  $. This leads to an equation where the coefficients and powers of  $ (x - x^*)  $ are equated on both sides. Simplifying the equation gives us two separate equations, one for the coefficients and another for the powers of  $ (x - x^*)  $.\n\nThe coefficients' equation is:\n$ \n\\alpha p \\left(p - 2\\right) \\left(p - 1\\right) = \\alpha^{4} p^{4}\n$ \n\nThe powers' equation is:\n$ \np - 3 = 4 p - 4\n$ \n\nSolving this system of equations provides the values of  $ \\alpha  $ and  $ p  $. \nA valid solution is identified if  $ \\alpha  $ and  $ p  $ are both nonzero. \nIn such a case, the solution for  $ \\alpha  $ and  $ p  $ is found to be:\n$ \n\\alpha = \\sqrt[3]{30}, \\quad p = \\frac{1}{3}\n$ \n\nWith these values, the integration constant  $ C  $ is determined by substituting \na known point from the numerical solution into the ansatz.

Given the initial conditions:\n $ y(0) = 1, \\quad y'(0) = 0, \\quad y''(0) = 0 $ \nwe can start by expanding  $y(x) $ as:\n $ y(x) \\approx y(0) + y'(0) x + \\frac{y''(0)}{2} x^2 + \\frac{y'''(0)}{6} x^3 + \\cdots $ \n\nSince  $y'(0) = 0 $ and  $y''(0) = 0 $, the expansion simplifies to:\n $ y(x) \\approx 1 + \\frac{y'''(0)}{6} x^3 + \\cdots $ \n\nTo find  $y'''(0) $, we evaluate the ODE at  $x = 0 $:\n $ y'''(0) = \\frac{1}{2 \\cdot 0^4 - 9 \\cdot 0 - 4} + 0^4 + \\frac{0}{2 \\cdot 0^3 - 18 \\cdot 0 - 5} - 5 e^{-0} $ \n $ y'''(0) = \\frac{1}{-4} - 5 $ \n $ y'''(0) = -\\frac{1}{4} - 5 = -\\frac{21}{4} $ \n\nThus, the Taylor series expansion around  $x = 0 $ is:\n $ y(x) \\approx 1 - \\frac{21}{24} x^3 $ \n\n### Large  $x $ Regime\nFor large  $x $, we can consider the dominant terms in the ODE.

The solution is thus $ y{\\left(x \\right)} = 1 - \\frac{5 x^{3}}{6}$  in the small x regime.\n\nThe solution for the large  $ x  $ regime uses an ansatz of the form \n$  y = \\alpha (x - x^*)^p, $  \nwhere  $ x^*  $ is the divergence point.

Thus, the equation simplifies to:\n $\ny''' \\approx y'^2 - 3\n$ \nThis is still a complex nonlinear ODE, but for an asymptotic approximation, we might consider a simpler form where  $y $ approaches a constant as  $x \\to \\infty $. Let's assume  $y \\approx C $ where  $C $ is a constant, then  $y' = 0 $,  $y'' = 0 $, and  $y''' = 0 $. The equation simplifies to:\n $\n0 \\approx -3\n$ \nThis is not consistent, suggesting that  $y $ does not approach a constant. A more detailed analysis or numerical methods might be required for a better approximation at large  $x $.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe approximations are:\n $\n\\boxed{[y = 1 - 1.2222 x^3]}\n$ \nFor large  $x $, a more detailed analysis is needed beyond simple assumptions.\n\n and this ground truth         solution: The dominant balance in the small x regime is given by  $frac{d^{3}}{d x^{3}} y = -3 - 4 e^{- x},$  and the dominant balance in the large x regime is given by  $frac{d^{3}}{d x^{3}} y = \\left(\\frac{d}{d x} y\\right)^{2}$ \nUsing the dominant balance in the small x regime, the solution can be derived by     setting $x=0$, analytically solving the dominant balance equation     for y, and plugging in the initial conditions. The solution is thus $ y{\\left(x \\right)} = 1 - \\frac{7 x^{3}}{6}$  in the small x regime.\n\nThe solution for the large  $ x  $ regime uses an ansatz of the form \n$  y = \\alpha (x - x^*)^p, $  \nwhere  $ x^*  $ is the divergence point.

This leads to an equation where the coefficients and powers of  $ (x - x^*)  $ are equated on both sides. Simplifying the equation gives us two separate equations, one for the coefficients and another for the powers of  $ (x - x^*)  $.\n\nThe coefficients' equation is:\n$ \n\\alpha p \\left(p - 2\\right) \\left(p - 1\\right) = \\alpha^{2} p^{2}\n$ \n\nThe powers' equation is:\n$ \np - 3 = 2 p - 2\n$ \n\nSolving this system of equations provides the values of  $ \\alpha  $ and  $ p  $. \nA valid solution is identified if  $ \\alpha  $ and  $ p  $ are both nonzero. \nIn such a case, the solution for  $ \\alpha  $ and  $ p  $ is found to be:\n$ \n\\alpha = -6, \\quad p = -1\n$ \n\nWith these values, the integration constant  $ C  $ is determined by substituting \na known point from the numerical solution into the ansatz.

The solution is thus $ y{\\left(x \\right)} = 1 - \\frac{x^{3}}{12}$  in the small x regime.\n\nThe solution for the large  $ x  $ regime uses an ansatz of the form \n$  y = \\alpha (x - x^*)^p, $  \nwhere  $ x^*  $ is the divergence point.

This leads to an equation where the coefficients and powers of  $ (x - x^*)  $ are equated on both sides. Simplifying the equation gives us two separate equations, one for the coefficients and another for the powers of  $ (x - x^*)  $.\n\nThe coefficients' equation is:\n$ \n\\alpha p \\left(p - 2\\right) \\left(p - 1\\right) = \\alpha^{4} p^{4}\n$ \n\nThe powers' equation is:\n$ \np - 3 = 4 p - 4\n$ \n\nSolving this system of equations provides the values of  $ \\alpha  $ and  $ p  $. \nA valid solution is identified if  $ \\alpha  $ and  $ p  $ are both nonzero. \nIn such a case, the solution for  $ \\alpha  $ and  $ p  $ is found to be:\n$ \n\\alpha = \\sqrt[3]{30}, \\quad p = \\frac{1}{3}\n$ \n\nWith these values, the integration constant  $ C  $ is determined by substituting \na known point from the numerical solution into the ansatz.

The term   $frac{1}{-3x^4} $ will dominate the behavior as  $x \\to \\infty $. Thus, the differential equation simplifies to:\n $\ny''' \\approx \\frac{1}{-3x^4}\n$ \nIntegrating three times and ignoring constants of integration (since we are looking for dominant behavior):\n $\ny'' \\approx \\frac{1}{-9x^3}, \\quad y' \\approx \\frac{1}{-27x^2}, \\quad y \\approx \\frac{1}{-81x}\n$ \nThis suggests that  $y(x) \\approx \\frac{1}{-81x} $ for large  $x $.\n\n### Final Answer\n $\n\\boxed{[y = 1 - \\frac{5}{36}x^3, y = \\frac{1}{-81x}]}\n$ \n\n and this ground truth         solution: The dominant balance in the small x regime is given by  $frac{d^{3}}{d x^{3}} y = \\frac{1}{- 3 x^{4} + 3 x^{3} + 6 x^{2} + \\cos{\\left(x \\right)} - 3},$  and the dominant balance in the large x regime is given by  $frac{d^{3}}{d x^{3}} y = \\left(\\frac{d}{d x} y\\right)^{2}$ \nUsing the dominant balance in the small x regime, the solution can be derived by     setting $x=0$, analytically solving the dominant balance equation     for y, and plugging in the initial conditions. The solution is thus $ y{\\left(x \\right)} = 1 - \\frac{x^{3}}{12}$  in the small x regime.\n\nThe solution for the large  $ x  $ regime uses an ansatz of the form \n$  y = \\alpha (x - x^*)^p, $  \nwhere  $ x^*  $ is the divergence point. Plugging in the ansatz and solving for the terms yields \n$ \n\\alpha p \\left(p - 2\\right) \\left(p - 1\\right) \\left(x - 9.39093909390939\\right)^{p - 3} = \\alpha^{2} p^{2} \\left(x - 9.39093909390939\\right)^{2 p - 2}\n$ \n\nAfter substituting the derivatives, the equation is reorganized to collect terms with respect to  $ (x - x^*)  $. This leads to an equation where the coefficients and powers of  $ (x - x^*)  $ are equated on both sides. Simplifying the equation gives us two separate equations, one for the coefficients and another for the powers of  $ (x - x^*)  $.\n\nThe coefficients' equation is:\n$ \n\\alpha p \\left(p - 2\\right) \\left(p - 1\\right) = \\alpha^{2} p^{2}\n$ \n\nThe powers' equation is:\n$ \np - 3 = 2 p - 2\n$ \n\nSolving this system of equations provides the values of  $ \\alpha  $ and  $ p  $. \nA valid solution is identified if  $ \\alpha  $ and  $ p  $ are both nonzero. \nIn such a case, the solution for  $ \\alpha  $ and  $ p  $ is found to be:\n$ \n\\alpha = -6, \\quad p = -1\n$ \n\nWith these values, the integration constant  $ C  $ is determined by substituting \na known point from the numerical solution into the ansatz. This yields the following equation for  $ C  $:\n$ \n61.2446961654432 = C + 66.6599999999993\n$ \n\nSolving this equation, we find the value of  $ C  $ to be:\n$ \nC = -5.4153038345561,\n$ \n\nso, the analytical approximation for the solution at large $x$ (near the divergence point) is given by\n$ \ny = -6 (x - 9.39093909390939)^{-1} + (-5.4153038345561),\n$ \n\nand the analytical approximation for the solution at small $x$ is given by\n$ \ny = 1 - \\frac{x^{3}}{12}.\n$ \n\nThus, the solution is given by \n $boxed{[y = 1 - \\frac{x^{3}}{12}, y = -6 (x - 9.39093909390939)^{-1} + (-5.4153038345561)]}$ \n\n and grade the response based on the following criteria:\n\n1) Check both the small and large $\\epsilon$ solutions.         2) For small regime solution, only give full credit if it matches the formula in the answer key exactly;         give no credit if it is doesn't match the form. For large regime solution, give full credit if it matches the         formula in the answer key exactly; give partial credit if it doesn't match but the numerical evaluation is         not far from solution at this regime; give no credit if neither satisfies         3) Average the scores for the small and large epsilon solutions to obtain a final score between 0 and 1.         4) Give the final grading as a float in Latex boxed format \\[boxed{}\\]",
