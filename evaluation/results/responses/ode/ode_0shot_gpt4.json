Near \\(x=0\\), higher powers of \\(x\\) in the denominators can be considered less significant compared to constants or lower powers of \\(x\\), and \\(e^{-x}\\) can be approximated by its Taylor expansion around \\(x=0\\), which is \\(1 - x + \\frac{x^2}{2} - \\frac{x^3}{6} + \\cdots\\).\n\nGiven the initial conditions, the simplest approximation for small \\(x\\) could neglect the \\(x\\) dependent terms in the denominators and focus on the constant terms and the leading behavior of \\(e^{-x}\\). However, the presence of \\(y'\\), \\(y''\\), and \\(y'''\\) alongside the initial conditions suggests that the initial behavior of \\(y(x)\\) could closely follow the \\(e^{-x}\\) pattern for very small \\(x\\), but the exact analytical expression would require solving the differential equation, which is not straightforward given its complexity.\n\n### For Large \\(x\\)\n\nFor large \\(x\\), the terms with the highest powers of \\(x\\) in the denominators dominate. Thus, the equation simplifies to:\n\n\\[y''' \\approx \\frac{y}{5x^4} + y'^{2} + \\frac{y''}{2x^4} + e^{-x}\\]\n\nAs \\(x\\) approaches infinity, \\(e^{-x}\\) rapidly approaches \\(0\\), and we can neglect it for the large \\(x\\) approximation. We're left with terms that involve \\(y\\), \\(y'\\), and \\(y''\\) divided by powers of \\(x\\).

Near  $ x=0 $ , higher powers of  $ x $  in the denominators can be considered less significant compared to constants or lower powers of  $ x $ , and  $ e^{-x} $  can be approximated by its Taylor expansion around  $ x=0 $ , which is  $ 1 - x + \\frac{x^2}{2} - \\frac{x^3}{6} + \\cdots $ .\n\nGiven the initial conditions, the simplest approximation for small  $ x $  could neglect the  $ x $  dependent terms in the denominators and focus on the constant terms and the leading behavior of  $ e^{-x} $ . However, the presence of  $ y' $ ,  $ y'' $ , and  $ y''' $  alongside the initial conditions suggests that the initial behavior of  $ y(x) $  could closely follow the  $ e^{-x} $  pattern for very small  $ x $ , but the exact analytical expression would require solving the differential equation, which is not straightforward given its complexity.\n\n### For Large  $ x $ \n\nFor large  $ x $ , the terms with the highest powers of  $ x $  in the denominators dominate. Thus, the equation simplifies to:\n\n $ y''' \\approx \\frac{y}{5x^4} + y'^{2} + \\frac{y''}{2x^4} + e^{-x}$  \n\nAs  $ x $  approaches infinity,  $ e^{-x} $  rapidly approaches  $ 0 $ , and we can neglect it for the large  $ x $  approximation. We're left with terms that involve  $ y $ ,  $ y' $ , and  $ y'' $  divided by powers of  $ x $ . An exact solution in this regime would depend significantly on the interplay of these terms, but given the dominance of  $ x^4 $  in the denominators, one might speculate about solutions that stabilize or grow at rates slower than  $ x^4 $ .\n\n### Finding Analytical Expressions\n\nFinding exact analytical expressions that satisfy these approximations and the initial conditions precisely, without solving the full differential equation, is challenging.

For precise solutions, one would need to solve the differential equation analytically (if possible) or numerically, taking into account the full dynamics and the initial conditions.\n\n and this ground truth solution: The dominant balance in the small x regime is given by $  $ frac{d^{3}}{d x^{3}} y = e^{- x},$ $  and the dominant balance in the large x regime is given by $  $ frac{d^{3}}{d x^{3}} y = \\left(\\frac{d}{d x} y\\right)^{2}$ $ \nUsing the dominant balance in the small x regime, the solution can be derived by     setting $ x=0$ , analytically solving the dominant balance equation     for y, and plugging in the initial conditions. The solution is thus $ $ y{\\left(x \\right)} = \\frac{x^{3}}{6} + 1$ $  in the small x regime.\n\nThe solution for the large  $  x  $  regime uses an ansatz of the form \n$ $  y = \\alpha (x - x^*)^p, $ $  \nwhere  $  x^*  $  is the divergence point. Plugging in the ansatz and solving for the terms yields \n$ $ \n\\alpha p \\left(p - 2\\right) \\left(p - 1\\right) \\left(x - 4.4004400440044\\right)^{p - 3} = \\alpha^{2} p^{2} \\left(x - 4.4004400440044\\right)^{2 p - 2}\n$ $ \n\nAfter substituting the derivatives, the equation is reorganized to collect terms with respect to  $  (x - x^*)  $ . This leads to an equation where the coefficients and powers of  $  (x - x^*)  $  are equated on both sides.

Therefore, we'll simplify the equation by approximating denominators with the smallest non-zero power terms of  $ x $ , assuming  $ x $  is close to 0.\n\nThe given ODE is:\n $ y''' = \\frac{y}{4 x^{3} + 5 x^{2} - 2} + y'^{2} - \\frac{y''}{20 x^{3} + 25 x^{2} - 5} + \\frac{1}{4 x^{4} + x + \\cos(x) - 3}$  \n\nFor small  $ x $ , approximate as follows:\n- The term  $ 4 x^{3} + 5 x^{2} - 2 \\approx -2 $ \n- The term  $ 20 x^{3} + 25 x^{2} - 5 \\approx -5 $ \n- The term  $ 4 x^{4} + x + \\cos(x) - 3 \\approx \\cos(0) - 3 = -2 $  (using   $ cos(0) = 1 $ )\n\nHence, the simplified equation is:\n $ y''' \\approx \\frac{y}{-2} + y'^{2} - \\frac{y''}{-5} + \\frac{1}{-2}$  \n\nGiven the initial conditions, we can integrate this simplified equation for an approximation in the small  $ x $  regime. However, finding an exact analytical solution through integration for even this simplified equation is non-trivial without further approximations or assumptions. For a general approach without detailed integration, we'll note this simplification as our small  $ x $  approximation base.\n\n### Large  $ x $  Regime\n\nFor large  $ x $ , the highest powers of  $ x $  dominate the behavior. Thus, we approximate the equation by considering only the highest power of  $ x $  in each term.\n\n- The term  $ 4 x^{3} $  dominates in  $ 4 x^{3} + 5 x^{2} - 2 $ \n- The term  $ 20 x^{3} $  dominates in  $ 20 x^{3} + 25 x^{2} - 5 $ \n- The term  $ 4 x^{4} $  dominates in  $ 4 x^{4} + x + \\cos(x) - 3 $ \n\nThus, the equation simplifies to:\n $ y''' \\approx \\frac{y}{4 x^{3}} + y'^{2} - \\frac{y''}{20 x^{3}} + \\frac{1}{4 x^{4}}$  \n\nThis approximation suggests a leading behavior in  $ y $  that scales with powers of  $ x $ , particularly for terms without  $ y $ ,  $ y' $ , or  $ y'' $ .\n\n### Analytical Expressions\n\nFor the small  $ x $  regime, without further simplifications or assumptions, we'll note an approximation based on the simplified ODE structure (assuming potential linear or simple polynomial behavior due to the nature of the equation and the initial conditions).\n\nFor the large  $ x $  regime, the behavior suggests a scaling with  $ x $  where the  $ y $ ,  $ y' $ , and  $ y'' $  terms may follow inverse cubic or quartic behaviors, but exact forms depend on integration and balancing these terms.\n\nGiven these considerations and the complexity of deriving exact forms without explicit integration steps, we'll provide general placeholders for the approximate forms in both regimes:\n\n $ \n\\boxed{[y \\approx 1 - Ax^2, y \\approx B/x^3]}\n$  \n\nwhere  $ A $  and  $ B $  are constants that could be determined by further detailed analysis or fitting to the boundary conditions and the simplified ODE structures in each regime. This representation is indicative of the approach rather than a finalized analytical solution.\n\n and this ground truth solution: The dominant balance in the small x regime is given by $  $ frac{d^{3}}{d x^{3}} y = \\frac{1}{4 x^{4} + x + \\cos{\\left(x \\right)} - 3},$ $  and the dominant balance in the large x regime is given by $  $ frac{d^{3}}{d x^{3}} y = \\left(\\frac{d}{d x} y\\right)^{2}$ $ \nUsing the dominant balance in the small x regime, the solution can be derived by     setting $ x=0$ , analytically solving the dominant balance equation     for y, and plugging in the initial conditions. The solution is thus $ $ y{\\left(x \\right)} = 1 - \\frac{x^{3}}{12}$ $  in the small x regime.\n\nThe solution for the large  $  x  $  regime uses an ansatz of the form \n$ $  y = \\alpha (x - x^*)^p, $ $  \nwhere  $  x^*  $  is the divergence point. Plugging in the ansatz and solving for the terms yields \n$ $ \n\\alpha p \\left(p - 2\\right) \\left(p - 1\\right) \\left(x - 7.24072407240724\\right)^{p - 3} = \\alpha^{2} p^{2} \\left(x - 7.24072407240724\\right)^{2 p - 2}\n$ $ \n\nAfter substituting the derivatives, the equation is reorganized to collect terms with respect to  $  (x - x^*)  $ . This leads to an equation where the coefficients and powers of  $  (x - x^*)  $  are equated on both sides. Simplifying the equation gives us two separate equations, one for the coefficients and another for the powers of  $  (x - x^*)  $ .\n\nThe coefficients' equation is:\n$ $ \n\\alpha p \\left(p - 2\\right) \\left(p - 1\\right) = \\alpha^{2} p^{2}\n$ $ \n\nThe powers' equation is:\n$ $ \np - 3 = 2 p - 2\n$ $ \n\nSolving this system of equations provides the values of  $  \\alpha  $  and  $  p  $ . \nA valid solution is identified if  $  \\alpha  $  and  $  p  $  are both nonzero. \nIn such a case, the solution for  $  \\alpha  $  and  $  p  $  is found to be:\n$ $ \n\\alpha = -6, \\quad p = -1\n$ $ \n\nWith these values, the integration constant  $  C  $  is determined by substituting \na known point from the numerical solution into the ansatz. This yields the following equation for  $  C  $ :\n$ $ \n63.5731410995865 = C + 66.66\n$ $ \n\nSolving this equation, we find the value of  $  C  $  to be:\n$ $ \nC = -3.0868589004135,\n$ $ \n\nso, the analytical approximation for the solution at large $ x$  (near the divergence point) is given by\n$ $ \ny = -6 (x - 7.24072407240724)^{-1} + (-3.0868589004135),\n$ $ \n\nand the analytical approximation for the solution at small $ x$  is given by\n$ $ \ny = 1 - \\frac{x^{3}}{12}.\n$ $ \n\nThus, the solution is given by \n$  $ boxed{[y = 1 - \\frac{x^{3}}{12}, y = -6 (x - 7.24072407240724)^{-1} + (-3.0868589004135)]}$ $ \n\n\n\nPlease grade the response based on the following criteria:\n\n You only need to take the analytical expression solutions for small and large x regimes in response and solution for comparison.

Here, the terms with the highest powers of  $ x $  in the denominators dominate.\n\nSimplifying, the dominant terms for large  $ x $  are:\n\n $ y''' \\approx \\frac{y}{2x^{4}} - \\frac{y''}{16x^{3}} - \\frac{1}{3x^{4}},$  \n\nwhich simplifies the behavior significantly, but finding an exact analytical solution becomes challenging without resorting to specific techniques or approximations tailored to the form of the equation.\n\nFor large  $ x $ , we might anticipate that the solution behavior could be dominated by the  $ x^{-4} $  terms, leading to solutions that asymptotically approach a constant value or diminish as  $ x $  grows, especially considering the impact of the  $ y/x^{4} $  term.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nGiven the complexity and the necessity for precise analytical or numerical methods to find exact forms, the proposed approximations are qualitative and intended to provide insight into the behavior of the solution in the specified regimes:\n\n $ \n\\boxed{[y \\approx 1 - a x^3, y \\approx b x^{-3} + c]}\n$  \n\nwhere  $ a $ ,  $ b $ , and  $ c $  are constants that would be determined through more detailed analysis or numerical approximation specific to the ODE's form and boundary conditions. Note, this is a conceptual approximation to guide towards a more rigorous solution.\n\n and this ground truth solution: The dominant balance in the small x regime is given by $  $ frac{d^{3}}{d x^{3}} y = \\frac{y}{2 \\left(x^{4} - 3 x^{2} - 1\\right)},$ $  and the dominant balance in the large x regime is given by $  $ frac{d^{3}}{d x^{3}} y = \\left(\\frac{d}{d x} y\\right)^{4}$ $ \nUsing the dominant balance in the small x regime, the solution can be derived by     setting $ x=0$ , analytically solving the dominant balance equation     for y, and plugging in the initial conditions. The solution is thus $ $ y{\\left(x \\right)} = 1 - \\frac{x^{3}}{12}$ $  in the small x regime.\n\nThe solution for the large  $  x  $  regime uses an ansatz of the form \n$ $  y = \\alpha (x - x^*)^p, $ $  \nwhere  $  x^*  $  is the divergence point. Plugging in the ansatz and solving for the terms yields \n$ $ \n\\alpha p \\left(p - 2\\right) \\left(p - 1\\right) \\left(x - 7.43074307430743\\right)^{p - 3} = \\alpha^{4} p^{4} \\left(x - 7.43074307430743\\right)^{4 p - 4}\n$ $ \n\nAfter substituting the derivatives, the equation is reorganized to collect terms with respect to  $  (x - x^*)  $ . This leads to an equation where the coefficients and powers of  $  (x - x^*)  $  are equated on both sides. Simplifying the equation gives us two separate equations, one for the coefficients and another for the powers of  $  (x - x^*)  $ .\n\nThe coefficients' equation is:\n$ $ \n\\alpha p \\left(p - 2\\right) \\left(p - 1\\right) = \\alpha^{4} p^{4}\n$ $ \n\nThe powers' equation is:\n$ $ \np - 3 = 4 p - 4\n$ $ \n\nSolving this system of equations provides the values of  $  \\alpha  $  and  $  p  $ . \nA valid solution is identified if  $  \\alpha  $  and  $  p  $  are both nonzero. \nIn such a case, the solution for  $  \\alpha  $  and  $  p  $  is found to be:\n$ $ \n\\alpha = \\sqrt[3]{30}, \\quad p = \\frac{1}{3}\n$ $ \n\nWith these values, the integration constant  $  C  $  is determined by substituting \na known point from the numerical solution into the ansatz.

For the purpose of this exercise, let's focus on the dominant balance for small $ x$ .\n\nGiven the initial conditions and the dominance of constant coefficients, a very rough approximation ignoring non-linear terms for the sake of a straightforward analytical expression might lead us to consider only linear terms (though recognizing this is a significant simplification):\n\n $ y''' \\approx -\\frac{y}{3} + \\frac{1}{-5}$  \n\nA particular solution to this simplified equation could yield a polynomial expression, but due to the simplification made, let's acknowledge that a direct analytical solution for small $ x$  that is accurate might not be feasible without numerical methods for the full equation. Therefore, for the sake of proceeding with this exercise, we might suggest a placeholder solution that acknowledges the simplification.\n\n### For Large $ x$  Regime\nIn the limit of large $ x$ , the terms with the highest powers of $ x$  in the denominators become dominant. Thus, the ODE simplifies to:\n\n $ y''' \\approx -\\frac{y}{8 x^2} + y'^{4} - \\frac{y''}{3 x^4} + \\frac{1}{6 x^2}$  \n\nThis simplification reflects the dominance of the $ x^2$  and $ x^4$  terms in the denominators for large $ x$ . However, solving this expression analytically remains challenging due to the non-linear term $ y'^4$  and the varying coefficients.\n\nFor large $ x$ , we might expect the solution to be influenced significantly by the $ y'^4$  term and the inverse powers of $ x$ , but obtaining a precise analytical expression without numerical methods is complex.\n\n### Conclusion\nGiven the complexity and the nonlinear nature of the original ODE, providing exact analytical solutions for both small and large $ x$  regimes without resorting to numerical methods or deeper simplification is challenging. The above discussion provides a framework for how one might begin to tackle the problem analytically, but it should be noted that, especially for nonlinear ODEs, numerical solutions are often necessary.\n\nTherefore, acknowledging the limitations of this analysis and the approximations made:\n\n $ \n\\boxed{[y \\approx 1 - \\frac{x^3}{3} + \\frac{x^4}{12}, \\ \\text{Placeholder for large } x \\ \\text{regime}]}\n$  \n\nThis boxed solution includes a placeholder for the large $ x$  regime, given the difficulty in finding a simple analytical expression without further assumptions or simplifications.\n\n and this ground truth solution: The dominant balance in the small x regime is given by $  $ frac{d^{3}}{d x^{3}} y = - \\frac{y}{8 x^{2} + 3},$ $  and the dominant balance in the large x regime is given by $  $ frac{d^{3}}{d x^{3}} y = \\left(\\frac{d}{d x} y\\right)^{4}$ $ \nUsing the dominant balance in the small x regime, the solution can be derived by     setting $ x=0$ , analytically solving the dominant balance equation     for y, and plugging in the initial conditions. The solution is thus $ $ y{\\left(x \\right)} = 1 - \\frac{x^{3}}{18}$ $  in the small x regime.\n\nThe solution for the large  $  x  $  regime uses an ansatz of the form \n$ $  y = \\alpha (x - x^*)^p, $ $  \nwhere  $  x^*  $  is the divergence point. Plugging in the ansatz and solving for the terms yields \n$ $ \n\\alpha p \\left(p - 2\\right) \\left(p - 1\\right) \\left(x - 10.5610561056106\\right)^{p - 3} = \\alpha^{4} p^{4} \\left(x - 10.5610561056106\\right)^{4 p - 4}\n$ $ \n\nAfter substituting the derivatives, the equation is reorganized to collect terms with respect to  $  (x - x^*)  $ . This leads to an equation where the coefficients and powers of  $  (x - x^*)  $  are equated on both sides. Simplifying the equation gives us two separate equations, one for the coefficients and another for the powers of  $  (x - x^*)  $ .\n\nThe coefficients' equation is:\n$ $ \n\\alpha p \\left(p - 2\\right) \\left(p - 1\\right) = \\alpha^{4} p^{4}\n$ $ \n\nThe powers' equation is:\n$ $ \np - 3 = 4 p - 4\n$ $ \n\nSolving this system of equations provides the values of  $  \\alpha  $  and  $  p  $ . \nA valid solution is identified if  $  \\alpha  $  and  $  p  $  are both nonzero. \nIn such a case, the solution for  $  \\alpha  $  and  $  p  $  is found to be:\n$ $ \n\\alpha = \\sqrt[3]{30}, \\quad p = \\frac{1}{3}\n$ $ \n\nWith these values, the integration constant  $  C  $  is determined by substituting \na known point from the numerical solution into the ansatz.

The solution is thus $ $ y{\\left(x \\right)} = 1 - \\frac{x^{3}}{12}$ $  in the small x regime.\n\nThe solution for the large  $  x  $  regime uses an ansatz of the form \n$ $  y = \\alpha (x - x^*)^p, $ $  \nwhere  $  x^*  $  is the divergence point. Plugging in the ansatz and solving for the terms yields \n$ $ \n\\alpha p \\left(p - 2\\right) \\left(p - 1\\right) \\left(x - 8.95089508950895\\right)^{p - 3} = \\alpha^{4} p^{4} \\left(x - 8.95089508950895\\right)^{4 p - 4}\n$ $ \n\nAfter substituting the derivatives, the equation is reorganized to collect terms with respect to  $  (x - x^*)  $ . This leads to an equation where the coefficients and powers of  $  (x - x^*)  $  are equated on both sides. Simplifying the equation gives us two separate equations, one for the coefficients and another for the powers of  $  (x - x^*)  $ .\n\nThe coefficients' equation is:\n$ $ \n\\alpha p \\left(p - 2\\right) \\left(p - 1\\right) = \\alpha^{4} p^{4}\n$ $ \n\nThe powers' equation is:\n$ $ \np - 3 = 4 p - 4\n$ $ \n\nSolving this system of equations provides the values of  $  \\alpha  $  and  $  p  $ . \nA valid solution is identified if  $  \\alpha  $  and  $  p  $  are both nonzero. \nIn such a case, the solution for  $  \\alpha  $  and  $  p  $  is found to be:\n$ $ \n\\alpha = \\sqrt[3]{30}, \\quad p = \\frac{1}{3}\n$ $ \n\nWith these values, the integration constant  $  C  $  is determined by substituting \na known point from the numerical solution into the ansatz.

However, without losing generality for an approximation and considering initial conditions:\n\n- At $ x = 0$ , $ y(0) = 1$ , which matches our simplified form.\n- The terms involving derivatives would adjust based on balance with the neglected nonlinear terms for precise form.\n\n### Large $ x$  Regime\n\nFor large $ x$ , we consider terms that dominate for large values of $ x$ . The dominating terms in the denominators become $ 9x^3$ , $ 3x^4$ , and $ 8x^2$  respectively, making the ODE:\n\n $ y''' \\approx \\frac{y}{9x^3} + y'^{4} + \\frac{y''}{3x^4} - \\frac{1}{8x^2}$  \n\nIn this limit, the equation suggests the terms scale with powers of $ x$ . An analytical solution in this regime might focus on the balance between these terms, but exact forms depend heavily on solving the ODE directly, which is challenging without further simplifications.\n\nGiven the complexity of exact expressions and focusing on the significant terms:\n\n- The  $ frac{1}{8x^2}$  term suggests a perturbation or correction that scales inversely with $ x^2$ .\n- The terms involving $ y$ , $ y'$ , and $ y''$  suggest a dynamic balance that might include inverse powers of $ x$  or logarithmic terms, reflecting the changing influence of these terms with $ x$ .\n\nGiven the need for highly simplified, approximate analytical expressions respecting the initial conditions for small and large $ x$ , a more nuanced approach or specific method (like perturbation theory) would be needed for precise forms. For the sake of this exercise, assuming a simplistic approach:\n\nFor small $ x$ , considering the initial impact and ignoring complex dynamics:\n\n $ y \\approx 1 - \\frac{x^3}{5}$  \n\nFor large $ x$ , acknowledging the inverse square correction without solving the complex dynamics:\n\n $ y \\approx \\frac{A}{x^2}$  \n\nHowever, these are very rough approximations, acknowledging that the provided initial conditions and the complexity of the ODE suggest more intricate dynamics than captured here. Precise analytical solutions would require detailed methods beyond this simplified analysis.\n\n $ \n\\boxed{[y \\approx 1 - \\frac{x^3}{5}, y \\approx \\frac{A}{x^2}]}\n$  \n\nNoting that $ A$  in the large $ x$  regime approximation would be determined by matching conditions or extended analysis not fully explored here.\n\n and this ground truth solution: The dominant balance in the small x regime is given by $  $ frac{d^{3}}{d x^{3}} y = \\frac{y}{9 x^{3} + 9 x - 2},$ $  and the dominant balance in the large x regime is given by $  $ frac{d^{3}}{d x^{3}} y = \\left(\\frac{d}{d x} y\\right)^{4}$ $ \nUsing the dominant balance in the small x regime, the solution can be derived by     setting $ x=0$ , analytically solving the dominant balance equation     for y, and plugging in the initial conditions. The solution is thus $ $ y{\\left(x \\right)} = 1 - \\frac{x^{3}}{12}$ $  in the small x regime.\n\nThe solution for the large  $  x  $  regime uses an ansatz of the form \n$ $  y = \\alpha (x - x^*)^p, $ $  \nwhere  $  x^*  $  is the divergence point. Plugging in the ansatz and solving for the terms yields \n$ $ \n\\alpha p \\left(p - 2\\right) \\left(p - 1\\right) \\left(x - 89.4689468946895\\right)^{p - 3} = \\alpha^{4} p^{4} \\left(x - 89.4689468946895\\right)^{4 p - 4}\n$ $ \n\nAfter substituting the derivatives, the equation is reorganized to collect terms with respect to  $  (x - x^*)  $ . This leads to an equation where the coefficients and powers of  $  (x - x^*)  $  are equated on both sides. Simplifying the equation gives us two separate equations, one for the coefficients and another for the powers of  $  (x - x^*)  $ .\n\nThe coefficients' equation is:\n$ $ \n\\alpha p \\left(p - 2\\right) \\left(p - 1\\right) = \\alpha^{4} p^{4}\n$ $ \n\nThe powers' equation is:\n$ $ \np - 3 = 4 p - 4\n$ $ \n\nSolving this system of equations provides the values of  $  \\alpha  $  and  $  p  $ . \nA valid solution is identified if  $  \\alpha  $  and  $  p  $  are both nonzero. \nIn such a case, the solution for  $  \\alpha  $  and  $  p  $  is found to be:\n$ $ \n\\alpha = \\sqrt[3]{30}, \\quad p = \\frac{1}{3}\n$ $ \n\nWith these values, the integration constant  $  C  $  is determined by substituting \na known point from the numerical solution into the ansatz.

Given the initial conditions  $ y(0) = 1 $ ,  $ y'(0) = 0 $ , and  $ y''(0) = 0 $ , we can get  $ c = 1 $ , implying  $ y(x) \\approx 1 $  as the leading order approximation for very small  $ x $ .\n\n### Large  $ x $  Regime\n\nFor large  $ x $ , we need to consider the terms that grow fastest with  $ x $ . The dominant terms become:\n\n $ y''' \\approx y'^{5} + \\frac{1}{4 x^{4}}$  \n\nThis simplification assumes  $ y $ ,  $ y'' $ , and the other terms grow slower than  $ y'^5 $  and  $ 1/4x^4 $  at large  $ x $ . Finding an exact analytical expression in this regime is challenging without further assumptions. However, for a rough approximation, we might consider focusing on the dominant balance between the leading terms, though explicit solutions will depend on the behavior of  $ y'^5 $  term, which significantly complicates direct integration without a more specific form for  $ y' $ .\n\nGiven the complex nature of the equation and the need to simplify our approach significantly, we acknowledge that the above analysis is a basic approximation. For detailed solutions, numerical methods are generally more appropriate.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nGiven the analytical approach taken here, we find rough approximations for small and large  $ x $  without deriving explicit expressions for the latter due to its complexity. Thus, the analytical expressions can be summarized as:\n\n  $ boxed{[y = 1, \\text{ No explicit solution for large } x]}$  \n\nThis representation acknowledges the difficulty in finding explicit analytical solutions for the large  $ x $  regime under the given simplifications and initial conditions.\n\n and this ground truth solution: The dominant balance in the small x regime is given by $  $ frac{d^{3}}{d x^{3}} y = \\frac{1}{4 x^{4} + 8 x^{3} + 8 x + \\cos{\\left(x \\right)} - 2},$ $  and the dominant balance in the large x regime is given by $  $ frac{d^{3}}{d x^{3}} y = \\left(\\frac{d}{d x} y\\right)^{5}$ $ \nUsing the dominant balance in the small x regime, the solution can be derived by     setting $ x=0$ , analytically solving the dominant balance equation     for y, and plugging in the initial conditions. The solution is thus $ $ y{\\left(x \\right)} = 1 - \\frac{x^{3}}{6}$ $  in the small x regime.\n\nThe solution for the large  $  x  $  regime uses an ansatz of the form \n$ $  y = \\alpha (x - x^*)^p, $ $  \nwhere  $  x^*  $  is the divergence point. Plugging in the ansatz and solving for the terms yields \n$ $ \n\\alpha p \\left(p - 2\\right) \\left(p - 1\\right) \\left(x - 2.000200020002\\right)^{p - 3} = \\alpha^{5} p^{5} \\left(x - 2.000200020002\\right)^{5 p - 5}\n$ $ \n\nAfter substituting the derivatives, the equation is reorganized to collect terms with respect to  $  (x - x^*)  $ . This leads to an equation where the coefficients and powers of  $  (x - x^*)  $  are equated on both sides. Simplifying the equation gives us two separate equations, one for the coefficients and another for the powers of  $  (x - x^*)  $ .\n\nThe coefficients' equation is:\n$ $ \n\\alpha p \\left(p - 2\\right) \\left(p - 1\\right) = \\alpha^{5} p^{5}\n$ $ \n\nThe powers' equation is:\n$ $ \np - 3 = 5 p - 5\n$ $ \n\nSolving this system of equations provides the values of  $  \\alpha  $  and  $  p  $ . \nA valid solution is identified if  $  \\alpha  $  and  $  p  $  are both nonzero. \nIn such a case, the solution for  $  \\alpha  $  and  $  p  $  is found to be:\n$ $ \n\\alpha = - \\sqrt{2} \\cdot \\sqrt[4]{3}, \\quad p = \\frac{1}{2}\n$ $ \n\nWith these values, the integration constant  $  C  $  is determined by substituting \na known point from the numerical solution into the ansatz.

This leads to an equation where the coefficients and powers of  $  (x - x^*)  $  are equated on both sides. Simplifying the equation gives us two separate equations, one for the coefficients and another for the powers of  $  (x - x^*)  $ .\n\nThe coefficients' equation is:\n$ $ \n\\alpha p \\left(p - 2\\right) \\left(p - 1\\right) = \\alpha^{2} p^{2}\n$ $ \n\nThe powers' equation is:\n$ $ \np - 3 = 2 p - 2\n$ $ \n\nSolving this system of equations provides the values of  $  \\alpha  $  and  $  p  $ . \nA valid solution is identified if  $  \\alpha  $  and  $  p  $  are both nonzero. \nIn such a case, the solution for  $  \\alpha  $  and  $  p  $  is found to be:\n$ $ \n\\alpha = -6, \\quad p = -1\n$ $ \n\nWith these values, the integration constant  $  C  $  is determined by substituting \na known point from the numerical solution into the ansatz.

The solution is thus $ $ y{\\left(x \\right)} = 1 - \\frac{x^{3}}{12}$ $  in the small x regime.\n\nThe solution for the large  $  x  $  regime uses an ansatz of the form \n$ $  y = \\alpha (x - x^*)^p, $ $  \nwhere  $  x^*  $  is the divergence point. Plugging in the ansatz and solving for the terms yields \n$ $ \n\\alpha p \\left(p - 2\\right) \\left(p - 1\\right) \\left(x - 9.39093909390939\\right)^{p - 3} = \\alpha^{2} p^{2} \\left(x - 9.39093909390939\\right)^{2 p - 2}\n$ $ \n\nAfter substituting the derivatives, the equation is reorganized to collect terms with respect to  $  (x - x^*)  $ . This leads to an equation where the coefficients and powers of  $  (x - x^*)  $  are equated on both sides. Simplifying the equation gives us two separate equations, one for the coefficients and another for the powers of  $  (x - x^*)  $ .\n\nThe coefficients' equation is:\n$ $ \n\\alpha p \\left(p - 2\\right) \\left(p - 1\\right) = \\alpha^{2} p^{2}\n$ $ \n\nThe powers' equation is:\n$ $ \np - 3 = 2 p - 2\n$ $ \n\nSolving this system of equations provides the values of  $  \\alpha  $  and  $  p  $ . \nA valid solution is identified if  $  \\alpha  $  and  $  p  $  are both nonzero. \nIn such a case, the solution for  $  \\alpha  $  and  $  p  $  is found to be:\n$ $ \n\\alpha = -6, \\quad p = -1\n$ $ \n\nWith these values, the integration constant  $  C  $  is determined by substituting \na known point from the numerical solution into the ansatz. This yields the following equation for  $  C  $ :\n$ $ \n61.2446961654432 = C + 66.6599999999993\n$ $ \n\nSolving this equation, we find the value of  $  C  $  to be:\n$ $ \nC = -5.4153038345561,\n$ $ \n\nso, the analytical approximation for the solution at large $ x$  (near the divergence point) is given by\n$ $ \ny = -6 (x - 9.39093909390939)^{-1} + (-5.4153038345561),\n$ $ \n\nand the analytical approximation for the solution at small $ x$  is given by\n$ $ \ny = 1 - \\frac{x^{3}}{12}.\n$ $ \n\nThus, the solution is given by \n$  $ boxed{[y = 1 - \\frac{x^{3}}{12}, y = -6 (x - 9.39093909390939)^{-1} + (-5.4153038345561)]}$ $ \n\n\n\nPlease grade the response based on the following criteria:\n\n You only need to take the analytical expression solutions for small and large x regimes in response and solution for comparison. This grade's final score should be between 0 to 1. You need to consider both the small and large x solutions. For each solution, if it  completely matches the elements in ground truth give full credit, give half credit if it gets partially correct and give no credit if it's completely wrong (a way tp determine is see whether the ground truth solution and the response have order of magnitude difference at given x regime).
