        "response": "To solve this problem, we can follow similar steps as in the example solution. First, let's find the dominant balance in the small x regime.\n\nThe dominant balance in the small x regime is given by $$\\frac{d^3}{dx^3}y = \\frac{y}{9x^3+9x-2},$$and the dominant balance in the large x regime is given by $$\\frac{d^3}{dx^3}y = (y')^4+\\frac{(y'')^2}{(3x^4-3x^3-4)^2}-\\frac{1}{8x^2-\\sin(x)+5}.$$Using the dominant balance in the small x regime, we can set $x=0$ and analytically solve for y. Plugging in the initial conditions, we get $$y=1-\\frac{x^3}{18}.$$This is the analytical expression that approximates the solution of y(x) in the small x regime.\n\nTo find the dominant balance in the large x regime, we can use an ansatz of the form $$y=\\alpha(x-x_*)^p,$$where $x_*$ is the divergence point.

First, we find the dominant balance in both the small and large $ x$  regimes.\n\nFor small $ x$ , the dominant balance is given by:\n\n$  $ frac{d^3}{dx^3}y = - \\frac{y}{12 x^2 + 12 x - 5}$ $ \n\nWe can solve this equation analytically to obtain:\n\n$ $ y(x) = 1 - \\frac{x^3}{9}$ $ \n\nFor large $ x$ , the dominant balance is given by:\n\n$  $ frac{d^3}{dx^3}y = y'^4 - \\frac{y''}{8 x^2 + 4 x + 4} + \\frac{1}{3 x^4 + 2 x^3 + sin(x) - 5}$ $ \n\nWe can solve this equation using an ansatz of the form:\n\n$ $ y(x) = \\alpha (x-x_*)^p$ $ \n\nwhere $ x_* = 5$  is the divergence point. Plugging in the ansatz and solving for the terms yields:\n\n$  $ alpha p (p-2)(p-1) (x-x_*)^{p-3} = \\alpha^2 p^2 (x-x_*)^{2p-2}$ $ \n\nWe can then equate the coefficients and powers of $ (x-x_*)$  on both sides to obtain:\n\n$  $ alpha p (p-2)(p-1) = \\alpha^2 p^2$ $ \n\nand\n\n$ $ p-3= 2p-2$ $ \n\nSolving this system of equations gives us:\n\n$  $ alpha=-6, \\quad p=-1$ $ \n\nWith these values, the integration constant $ C$  is determined by substituting a known point from the numerical solution into the ansatz. This yields:\n\n$ $ 63.9257998942671 = C+66.6600000000007$ $ \n\nSolving this equation gives us:\n\n$ $ C=-2.7342001057336$ $ \n\nTherefore, the analytical approximation for the solution at large $ x$  (near the divergence point) is given by:\n\n$ $ y(x) = -6 (x-5)^{-1} + (-2.7342001057336)$ $ \n\nThe final answer is:\n\n$  $ boxed{[y=1-\\frac{x^3}{9}, y=-6/(x-5)+(-2.7342001057336)]}$ $ \n\n and this ground truth solution: The dominant balance in the small x regime is given by $  $ frac{d^{3}}{d x^{3}} y = \\frac{y}{12 x^{2} + 12 x - 5},$ $  and the dominant balance in the large x regime is given by $  $ frac{d^{3}}{d x^{3}} y = \\left(\\frac{d}{d x} y\\right)^{4}$ $ \nUsing the dominant balance in the small x regime, the solution can be derived by     setting $ x=0$ , analytically solving the dominant balance equation     for y, and plugging in the initial conditions. The solution is thus $ $ y{\\left(x \\right)} = 1 - \\frac{x^{3}}{30}$ $  in the small x regime.\n\nThe solution for the large  $  x  $  regime uses an ansatz of the form \n$ $  y = \\alpha (x - x^*)^p, $ $  \nwhere  $  x^*  $  is the divergence point. Plugging in the ansatz and solving for the terms yields \n$ $ \n\\alpha p \\left(p - 2\\right) \\left(p - 1\\right) \\left(x - 15.5615561556156\\right)^{p - 3} = \\alpha^{4} p^{4} \\left(x - 15.5615561556156\\right)^{4 p - 4}\n$ $ \n\nAfter substituting the derivatives, the equation is reorganized to collect terms with respect to  $  (x - x^*)  $ . This leads to an equation where the coefficients and powers of  $  (x - x^*)  $  are equated on both sides. Simplifying the equation gives us two separate equations, one for the coefficients and another for the powers of  $  (x - x^*)  $ .\n\nThe coefficients' equation is:\n$ $ \n\\alpha p \\left(p - 2\\right) \\left(p - 1\\right) = \\alpha^{4} p^{4}\n$ $ \n\nThe powers' equation is:\n$ $ \np - 3 = 4 p - 4\n$ $ \n\nSolving this system of equations provides the values of  $  \\alpha  $  and  $  p  $ . \nA valid solution is identified if  $  \\alpha  $  and  $  p  $  are both nonzero. \nIn such a case, the solution for  $  \\alpha  $  and  $  p  $  is found to be:\n$ $ \n\\alpha = \\sqrt[3]{30}, \\quad p = \\frac{1}{3}\n$ $ \n\nWith these values, the integration constant  $  C  $  is determined by substituting \na known point from the numerical solution into the ansatz. This yields the following equation for  $  C  $ :\n$ $ \n5.19636856786385 = C - 0.448155413667487 \\cdot \\sqrt[3]{30}\n$ $ \n\nSolving this equation, we find the value of  $  C  $  to be:\n$ $ \nC = 6.58889163693066,\n$ $ \n\nso, the analytical approximation for the solution at large $ x$  (near the divergence point) is given by\n$ $ \ny = \\sqrt[3]{30} (x - 15.5615561556156)^{\\frac{1}{3}} + (6.58889163693066),\n$ $ \n\nand the analytical approximation for the solution at small $ x$  is given by\n$ $ \ny = 1 - \\frac{x^{3}}{30}.\n$ $ \n\nThus, the solution is given by \n$  $ boxed{[y = 1 - \\frac{x^{3}}{30}, y = \\sqrt[3]{30} (x - 15.5615561556156)^{\\frac{1}{3}} + (6.58889163693066)]}$ $ \n\n\n\nPlease grade the response based on the following criteria:\n\n You only need to take the analytical expression solutions for small and large x regimes in response and solution for comparison.

        "grade_response": "To grade the response, we will evaluate the analytical expressions for the small and large \\( x \\) regimes separately.\n\n### Small \\( x \\) Regime:\n- Response: \\( y = 1 - \\frac{x^3}{18} \\)\n- Ground Truth: \\( y = 1 - \\frac{x^3}{12} \\)\n\nThe response and ground truth solutions for the small \\( x \\) regime have similar forms but different coefficients. Let's compare the coefficients:\n- Response: \\( -\\frac{1}{18} \\)\n- Ground Truth: \\( -\\frac{1}{12} \\)\n\nSince the coefficients are different but the forms are similar, we will give partial credit for this solution.\n\n### Large \\( x \\) Regime:\n- Response: \\( y = \\frac{-6}{x-5} + 2.5 \\)\n- Ground Truth: \\( y = -6 (x - 9.39093909390939)^{-1} + (-5.4153038345561) \\)\n\nThe response and ground truth solutions for the large \\( x \\) regime are similar in structure but different in the specific terms and constants. Hence, they follow the same functional form but differ in parameters. We will give partial credit for this solution as well.\n\n### Grading:\n- Small \\( x \\) Solution: 0.5 (partial credit)\n- Large \\( x \\) Solution: 0.5 (partial credit)\n\nThe final grade will be the average of the two scores, which is:\n\\[ \\boxed{0.5} \\]",
