Plugging in the ansatz and solving for the terms yields \n$ $ \n\\alpha p \\left(p - 2\\right) \\left(p - 1\\right) \\left(x - 2.59025902590259\\right)^{p - 3} = \\alpha^{4} p^{4} \\left(x - 2.59025902590259\\right)^{4 p - 4}\n$ $ \n\nAfter substituting the derivatives, the equation is reorganized to collect terms with respect to  $  (x - x^*)  $ . This leads to an equation where the coefficients and powers of  $  (x - x^*)  $  are equated on both sides.

        "response": "To solve this problem, let's follow the approach indicated in the example solutions by identifying the dominant balance in both the small and large \\(x\\) regimes, and then finding analytical expressions that approximate the solution of \\(y(x)\\) under these conditions.\n\n### Small \\(x\\) Regime\n\nFor small \\(x\\), the dominant term on the right-hand side of the differential equation is likely to be the one that does not depend heavily on high powers of \\(x\\) or oscillatory functions, which in this case is \\(-\\frac{1}{2 x - \\sin(x) + 8}\\) because it becomes a constant term when \\(x = 0\\).\n\nThus, the dominant balance equation in the small \\(x\\) regime can be approximated by:\n\\[y''' = -\\frac{1}{2 x - \\sin(x) + 8}\\]\n\nSince we are looking for an approximation near \\(x = 0\\), and acknowledging the initial conditions, we can simplify the right-hand side by evaluating the denominator at \\(x=0\\), leading to:\n\\[y''' = -\\frac{1}{8}\\]\n\nSolving this third-order differential equation with the given initial conditions, we integrate thrice:\n\\[y = -\\frac{x^3}{6 \\times 8} + 1 = 1 - \\frac{x^3}{48}\\]\n\n### Large \\(x\\) Regime\n\nFor large \\(x\\), the dominant term is expected to be \\(y'^4\\) since its growth could outpace the contributions from the other terms as \\(x\\) becomes large.\n\nThus, we postulate an ansatz for \\(y\\) in the form:\n\\[y = \\alpha (x - x^*)^p\\]\n\nSubstituting this into \\(y'^4\\), we get an equation involving powers of \\(x\\).

However, without conducting the full integration process here,  $ A $  remains symbolic, representing the effect of integrating the dominant term.\n\n2. **Large  $ x $  regime:**\n $ y(x) = \\alpha (x - x^{*})^{p}$  \nThe values of   $ alpha $ ,  $ x^{*} $ , and  $ p $  would be determined through a matching process involving the dominant balance equation  $ y''' \\approx y'^{4} $  and integration constants fixed by boundary or matching conditions. \n\nGiven these considerations, the analytical expressions in a form suitable for SymPy conversion, while remaining somewhat general due to the complexity of deriving explicit forms without further assumptions or numerical computation, are:\n\n $ \n\\boxed{[y = 1 - \\frac{x^{3}}{A}, y = \\alpha (x - x^{*})^{p}]}\n$  \n\nThis boxed expression represents a qualitative approximation for small and large  $ x $ , acknowledging that specific coefficients require either further assumptions or numerical methods for accurate determination.\n\n and this ground truth solution: The dominant balance in the small x regime is given by $  $ frac{d^{3}}{d x^{3}} y = \\frac{1}{12 x^{3} + \\cos{\\left(x \\right)} - 3},$ $  and the dominant balance in the large x regime is given by $  $ frac{d^{3}}{d x^{3}} y = \\left(\\frac{d}{d x} y\\right)^{4}$ $ \nUsing the dominant balance in the small x regime, the solution can be derived by     setting $ x=0$ , analytically solving the dominant balance equation     for y, and plugging in the initial conditions. The solution is thus $ $ y{\\left(x \\right)} = 1 - \\frac{x^{3}}{12}$ $  in the small x regime.\n\nThe solution for the large  $  x  $  regime uses an ansatz of the form \n$ $  y = \\alpha (x - x^*)^p, $ $  \nwhere  $  x^*  $  is the divergence point. Plugging in the ansatz and solving for the terms yields \n$ $ \n\\alpha p \\left(p - 2\\right) \\left(p - 1\\right) \\left(x - 12.3412341234123\\right)^{p - 3} = \\alpha^{4} p^{4} \\left(x - 12.3412341234123\\right)^{4 p - 4}\n$ $ \n\nAfter substituting the derivatives, the equation is reorganized to collect terms with respect to  $  (x - x^*)  $ . This leads to an equation where the coefficients and powers of  $  (x - x^*)  $  are equated on both sides. Simplifying the equation gives us two separate equations, one for the coefficients and another for the powers of  $  (x - x^*)  $ .\n\nThe coefficients' equation is:\n$ $ \n\\alpha p \\left(p - 2\\right) \\left(p - 1\\right) = \\alpha^{4} p^{4}\n$ $ \n\nThe powers' equation is:\n$ $ \np - 3 = 4 p - 4\n$ $ \n\nSolving this system of equations provides the values of  $  \\alpha  $  and  $  p  $ . \nA valid solution is identified if  $  \\alpha  $  and  $  p  $  are both nonzero. \nIn such a case, the solution for  $  \\alpha  $  and  $  p  $  is found to be:\n$ $ \n\\alpha = \\sqrt[3]{30}, \\quad p = \\frac{1}{3}\n$ $ \n\nWith these values, the integration constant  $  C  $  is determined by substituting \na known point from the numerical solution into the ansatz.

        "response": "To find analytical expressions that approximate the solution of the given third-order ordinary differential equation in the small $x$ and large $x$ regimes, we first identify the dominant balance at both regimes.\n\nFor the small $x$ regime, the dominant balance comes from considering terms that contribute significantly when $x$ is near zero. The non-linear term $y'^{4}$ and the exponential term $-2e^{-x}$, along with the constant term $-3$, are likely to be less significant compared to the others due to the initial conditions and the nature of the exponential function near zero. Thus, the dominant term is likely to come from the direct forcing term $-3 - 2e^{-x}$, as the other terms are scaled with powers of $x$ and the initial conditions make their contributions start from $0$.

        "grade_prompt": "Please take this response: To find analytical expressions that approximate the solution of the given third-order ordinary differential equation in the small $ x$  and large $ x$  regimes, we first identify the dominant balance at both regimes.\n\nFor the small $ x$  regime, the dominant balance comes from considering terms that contribute significantly when $ x$  is near zero. The non-linear term $ y'^{4}$  and the exponential term $ -2e^{-x}$ , along with the constant term $ -3$ , are likely to be less significant compared to the others due to the initial conditions and the nature of the exponential function near zero. Thus, the dominant term is likely to come from the direct forcing term $ -3 - 2e^{-x}$ , as the other terms are scaled with powers of $ x$  and the initial conditions make their contributions start from $ 0$ .

However, for consistency with the format, an approximation or speculative form could be taken as:\n\n $ y \\approx \\alpha (x - x^*)^p + C$  \n\nwhere   $ alpha $ ,  $ p $ , and  $ C $  are to be determined based on additional constraints or numerical fitting.\n\n### Solution\nThus, the requested analytical expressions in the given format are:\n\n $ \n\\boxed{[y = 1 - \\frac{x^{3}}{18}, y \\approx \\alpha (x - x^*)^p + C]}\n$  \n\nPlease note, the second expression is indicative and speculative due to the complex dynamics in the large  $ x $  regime without explicit solutions.\n\n and this ground truth solution: The dominant balance in the small x regime is given by $  $ frac{d^{3}}{d x^{3}} y = - \\frac{1}{6 x^{4} + 12 x^{3} - \\sin{\\left(x \\right)} + 3},$ $  and the dominant balance in the large x regime is given by $  $ frac{d^{3}}{d x^{3}} y = \\left(\\frac{d}{d x} y\\right)^{2}$ $ \nUsing the dominant balance in the small x regime, the solution can be derived by     setting $ x=0$ , analytically solving the dominant balance equation     for y, and plugging in the initial conditions. The solution is thus $ $ y{\\left(x \\right)} = 1 - \\frac{x^{3}}{18}$ $  in the small x regime.\n\nThe solution for the large  $  x  $  regime uses an ansatz of the form \n$ $  y = \\alpha (x - x^*)^p, $ $  \nwhere  $  x^*  $  is the divergence point. Plugging in the ansatz and solving for the terms yields \n$ $ \n\\alpha p \\left(p - 2\\right) \\left(p - 1\\right) \\left(x - 9.21092109210921\\right)^{p - 3} = \\alpha^{2} p^{2} \\left(x - 9.21092109210921\\right)^{2 p - 2}\n$ $ \n\nAfter substituting the derivatives, the equation is reorganized to collect terms with respect to  $  (x - x^*)  $ . This leads to an equation where the coefficients and powers of  $  (x - x^*)  $  are equated on both sides. Simplifying the equation gives us two separate equations, one for the coefficients and another for the powers of  $  (x - x^*)  $ .\n\nThe coefficients' equation is:\n$ $ \n\\alpha p \\left(p - 2\\right) \\left(p - 1\\right) = \\alpha^{2} p^{2}\n$ $ \n\nThe powers' equation is:\n$ $ \np - 3 = 2 p - 2\n$ $ \n\nSolving this system of equations provides the values of  $  \\alpha  $  and  $  p  $ . \nA valid solution is identified if  $  \\alpha  $  and  $  p  $  are both nonzero. \nIn such a case, the solution for  $  \\alpha  $  and  $  p  $  is found to be:\n$ $ \n\\alpha = -6, \\quad p = -1\n$ $ \n\nWith these values, the integration constant  $  C  $  is determined by substituting \na known point from the numerical solution into the ansatz. This yields the following equation for  $  C  $ :\n$ $ \n62.9707882534535 = C + 66.6599999999993\n$ $ \n\nSolving this equation, we find the value of  $  C  $  to be:\n$ $ \nC = -3.6892117465458,\n$ $ \n\nso, the analytical approximation for the solution at large $ x$  (near the divergence point) is given by\n$ $ \ny = -6 (x - 9.21092109210921)^{-1} + (-3.6892117465458),\n$ $ \n\nand the analytical approximation for the solution at small $ x$  is given by\n$ $ \ny = 1 - \\frac{x^{3}}{18}.\n$ $ \n\nThus, the solution is given by \n$  $ boxed{[y = 1 - \\frac{x^{3}}{18}, y = -6 (x - 9.21092109210921)^{-1} + (-3.6892117465458)]}$ $ \n\n\n\nPlease grade the response based on the following criteria:\n\n You only need to take the analytical expression solutions for small and large x regimes in response and solution for comparison. This grade's final score should be between 0 to 1. You need to consider both the small and large x solutions. For each solution, if it  completely matches the elements in ground truth give full credit, give half credit if it gets partially correct and give no credit if it's completely wrong (a way tp determine is see whether the ground truth solution and the response have order of magnitude difference at given x regime).

        "response": "To solve the given third-order ordinary differential equation in the small $x$ and large $x$ regimes, we'll follow a similar approach to the example solutions provided, considering the dominant balance method and initial conditions.\n\n### Small $x$ Regime\nFor small $x$ values, we need to consider the terms that dominate as $x$ approaches 0. In this case, the exponential term $e^{-x}$ becomes significant because it tends to 1 as $x$ approaches 0, and the other terms' influence diminishes due to the presence of $x$ in their denominators. Therefore, the dominant term is:\n\\[y''' = e^{-x}\\]\n\nGiven the initial conditions, we can solve this differential equation for an approximation near $x = 0$. The general solution for the homogeneous equation $y''' = 0$ is:\n\\[y_h = C_1 + C_2x + C_3x^2\\]\n\nIntegrating $e^{-x}$ three times gives us:\n\\[y_p = -\\frac{e^{-x}}{6} + \\frac{x^3}{6}\\]\n\nUsing the initial conditions $y(0) = 1, y'(0) = 0, y''(0) = 0$, we find $C_1 = 1, C_2 = 0, C_3 = 0$, and the particular solution contributes as $x \\to 0$, so:\n\\[y_{small} = 1 + \\left(-\\frac{e^{-x}}{6} + \\frac{x^3}{6}\\right)\\]\n\n### Large $x$ Regime\nFor large $x$ values, the $y'^{2}$ term is significant due to its potential to grow faster than the linear or inverse polynomial contributions of other terms as $x$ increases.

        "grade_prompt": "Please take this response: To solve the given third-order ordinary differential equation in the small $ x$  and large $ x$  regimes, we'll follow a similar approach to the example solutions provided, considering the dominant balance method and initial conditions.\n\n### Small $ x$  Regime\nFor small $ x$  values, we need to consider the terms that dominate as $ x$  approaches 0. In this case, the exponential term $ e^{-x}$  becomes significant because it tends to 1 as $ x$  approaches 0, and the other terms' influence diminishes due to the presence of $ x$  in their denominators. Therefore, the dominant term is:\n $ y''' = e^{-x}$  \n\nGiven the initial conditions, we can solve this differential equation for an approximation near $ x = 0$ . The general solution for the homogeneous equation $ y''' = 0$  is:\n $ y_h = C_1 + C_2x + C_3x^2$  \n\nIntegrating $ e^{-x}$  three times gives us:\n $ y_p = -\\frac{e^{-x}}{6} + \\frac{x^3}{6}$  \n\nUsing the initial conditions $ y(0) = 1, y'(0) = 0, y''(0) = 0$ , we find $ C_1 = 1, C_2 = 0, C_3 = 0$ , and the particular solution contributes as $ x \\to 0$ , so:\n $ y_{small} = 1 + \\left(-\\frac{e^{-x}}{6} + \\frac{x^3}{6}\\right)$  \n\n### Large $ x$  Regime\nFor large $ x$  values, the $ y'^{2}$  term is significant due to its potential to grow faster than the linear or inverse polynomial contributions of other terms as $ x$  increases. We propose an ansatz $ y = \\alpha (x - x^*)^p$  to solve for the dominant balance, but without explicit calculations for  $ alpha$  and $ p$  provided in the prompt, we proceed under the assumption that this term dictates the behavior:\n\n $ y''' \\approx y'^{2}$  \n\nSolving this specifically would require further assumptions about the behavior of $ y$  at large $ x$ , which are not directly provided, so we'll not derive the specific form for the large $ x$  regime from this information alone.\n\nGiven these considerations, the analytical expressions that approximate the solution of $ y(x)$  in the small $ x$  and large $ x$  regimes, considering the given hints and model, would be:\n\n $ \n\\boxed{[y = 1 - \\frac{e^{-x}}{6} + \\frac{x^3}{6}, y = \\text{Ansatz-based solution for large x not explicitly derived}]}\n$  \n\nFor the purpose of conforming to the provided instruction format and acknowledging the nondetailed solution path for large $ x$  regime here, the exact form of the large x regime solution is not provided.

        "response": "To solve this problem, we will analyze the dominant balances for both small $x$ and large $x$ regimes and then find analytical expressions that satisfy the given initial conditions.\n\n### Small $x$ Regime\n\nIn the small $x$ regime, all terms with $x$ in the denominator can be considered dominant if they diverge faster than others as $x$ approaches 0. However, given the specific initial conditions and the nature of the ODE, the exponential term $e^{-x}$ is expected to dominate because it's the most significant deviation from constant behavior near $x=0$.

For the large $ x$  regime, without further detailed analysis or assumptions, a specific form is not readily provided.\n\n $ \n\\boxed{[y = 1 - \\frac{x^3}{30}, \\text{Large } x \\text{ regime solution requires further specification}]}\n$  \n\n and this ground truth solution: The dominant balance in the small x regime is given by $  $ frac{d^{3}}{d x^{3}} y = - \\frac{y}{3 x^{3} + 9 x^{2} - 15 x + 2},$ $  and the dominant balance in the large x regime is given by $  $ frac{d^{3}}{d x^{3}} y = \\left(\\frac{d}{d x} y\\right)^{4}$ $ \nUsing the dominant balance in the small x regime, the solution can be derived by     setting $ x=0$ , analytically solving the dominant balance equation     for y, and plugging in the initial conditions. The solution is thus $ $ y{\\left(x \\right)} = 1 - \\frac{x^{3}}{12}$ $  in the small x regime.\n\nThe solution for the large  $  x  $  regime uses an ansatz of the form \n$ $  y = \\alpha (x - x^*)^p, $ $  \nwhere  $  x^*  $  is the divergence point.

This yields the following equation for  $  C  $ :\n$ $ \n61.2446961654432 = C + 66.6599999999993\n$ $ \n\nSolving this equation, we find the value of  $  C  $  to be:\n$ $ \nC = -5.4153038345561,\n$ $ \n\nso, the analytical approximation for the solution at large $ x$  (near the divergence point) is given by\n$ $ \ny = -6 (x - 9.39093909390939)^{-1} + (-5.4153038345561),\n$ $ \n\nand the analytical approximation for the solution at small $ x$  is given by\n$ $ \ny = 1 - \\frac{x^{3}}{12}.\n$ $ \n\nThus, the solution is given by \n$  $ boxed{[y = 1 - \\frac{x^{3}}{12}, y = -6 (x - 9.39093909390939)^{-1} + (-5.4153038345561)]}$ $ \n\n\n\nPlease grade the response based on the following criteria:\n\n You only need to take the analytical expression solutions for small and large x regimes in response and solution for comparison. This grade's final score should be between 0 to 1. You need to consider both the small and large x solutions. For each solution, if it  completely matches the elements in ground truth give full credit, give half credit if it gets partially correct and give no credit if it's completely wrong (a way tp determine is see whether the ground truth solution and the response have order of magnitude difference at given x regime). Give the final grading as a float in Latex boxed format \\[boxed{}\\].",
        "grade_response": "Let's evaluate the analytical expressions for the small and large \\( x \\) regimes provided in the response and the ground truth solution.\n\n### Small \\( x \\) Regime\n\n**Response:**\n\\[ y = 1 - \\frac{x^3}{6} \\]\n\n**Ground Truth:**\n\\[ y = 1 - \\frac{x^3}{12} \\]\n\nThe expressions differ only in the coefficient of \\( \\frac{x^3}{6} \\) versus \\( \\frac{x^3}{12} \\). This difference indicates a discrepancy in the order of magnitude. Therefore, the small \\( x \\) regime solution in the response is not completely correct.\n\n### Large \\( x \\) Regime\n\n**Response:**\n\\[ \\text{placeholder for large } x \\text{ regime solution} \\]\n\n**Ground Truth:**\n\\[ y = -6 (x - 9.39093909390939)^{-1} + (-5.4153038345561) \\]\n\nThe response does not provide a specific analytical expression for the large \\( x \\) regime but instead mentions the complexity and uses a placeholder. This is not an acceptable solution compared to the ground truth which provides a complete and specific form.\n\n### Grading\n\n- **Small \\( x \\) Regime:** The response is partially correct. \\(\\frac{x^3}{6}\\) and \\(\\frac{x^3}{12}\\) are different and hence the response gets half credit.\n- **Large \\( x \\) Regime:** The response is completely wrong because it does not provide any form of the solution.
