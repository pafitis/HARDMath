        "grade_prompt": "Please take this response: To find analytical expressions that approximate the solution of the given third-order ordinary differential equation in the small  $x $ and large  $x $ regimes, we first identify the dominant terms in these regimes.\n\n### Small  $x $ Regime\nFor small  $x $, we consider the terms that dominate when  $x $ approaches 0. The exponential term  $e^{-x} $ approaches 1 as  $x \\to 0 $, and the other terms involving  $x $ in the denominators are less significant near  $x = 0 $. Thus, the dominant balance in the small  $x $ regime is given by:\n $ y''' = e^{-x} $ \n\nUsing the initial conditions  $y(0) = 1 $,  $y'(0) = 0 $, and  $y''(0) = 0 $, we can approximate  $y(x) $ by solving the simplified equation:\n $ y''' = 1 $ \nIntegrating three times and using the initial conditions, we get:\n $ y'' = x $ \n $ y' = \\frac{x^2}{2} $ \n $ y = \\frac{x^3}{6} + 1 $ \n\n### Large  $x $ Regime\nFor large  $x $, the term  $y'^2 $ (quadratic in derivative) will dominate over the other terms as  $y' $ or  $y $ grows. Thus, the dominant balance in the large  $x $ regime is:\n $ y''' = y'^2 $ \n\nWe use an ansatz  $y = \\alpha (x - x^*)^p $ to find a solution form. Substituting and differentiating, we get:\n $ y' = \\alpha p (x - x^*)^{p-1} $ \n $ y'' = \\alpha p (p-1) (x - x^*)^{p-2} $ \n $ y''' = \\alpha p (p-1) (p-2) (x - x^*)^{p-3} $ \n\nPlugging these into the dominant balance equation:\n $ \\alpha p (p-1) (p-2) (x - x^*)^{p-3} = (\\alpha p (x - x^*)^{p-1})^2 $ \n $ \\alpha p (p-1) (p-2) = \\alpha^2 p^2 (x - x^*)^{2p-2} $ \n\nEquating powers and coefficients, we find:\n $ p - 3 = 2p - 2 $ \n $ p = -1 $ \n $ \\alpha (-1)(-2)(-3) = \\alpha^2 $ \n $ \\alpha = -6 $ \n\nThus, the solution in the large  $x $ regime is:\n $ y = -6 (x - x^*)^{-1} $ \n\n### Final Answer\nThe analytical approximations for the solution at small  $x $ and large  $x $ are:\n $ \\boxed{[y = \\frac{x^3}{6} + 1, y = -6 (x - x^*)^{-1}]} $ \n\n and this ground truth         solution: The dominant balance in the small x regime is given by  $frac{d^{3}}{d x^{3}} y = e^{- x},$  and the dominant balance in the large x regime is given by  $frac{d^{3}}{d x^{3}} y = \\left(\\frac{d}{d x} y\\right)^{2}$ \nUsing the dominant balance in the small x regime, the solution can be derived by     setting $x=0$, analytically solving the dominant balance equation     for y, and plugging in the initial conditions. The solution is thus $ y{\\left(x \\right)} = \\frac{x^{3}}{6} + 1$  in the small x regime.\n\nThe solution for the large  $ x  $ regime uses an ansatz of the form \n$  y = \\alpha (x - x^*)^p, $  \nwhere  $ x^*  $ is the divergence point.

This leads to an equation where the coefficients and powers of  $ (x - x^*)  $ are equated on both sides. Simplifying the equation gives us two separate equations, one for the coefficients and another for the powers of  $ (x - x^*)  $.\n\nThe coefficients' equation is:\n$ \n\\alpha p \\left(p - 2\\right) \\left(p - 1\\right) = \\alpha^{2} p^{2}\n$ \n\nThe powers' equation is:\n$ \np - 3 = 2 p - 2\n$ \n\nSolving this system of equations provides the values of  $ \\alpha  $ and  $ p  $. \nA valid solution is identified if  $ \\alpha  $ and  $ p  $ are both nonzero. \nIn such a case, the solution for  $ \\alpha  $ and  $ p  $ is found to be:\n$ \n\\alpha = -6, \\quad p = -1\n$ \n\nWith these values, the integration constant  $ C  $ is determined by substituting \na known point from the numerical solution into the ansatz.

Thus, the dominant balance is:\n $ y''' = y'^4 $ \nAssuming a solution of the form  $y = \\alpha (x - x^*)^p $, where  $x^* $ is a point of interest (e.g., a singularity or boundary), we substitute and equate the leading terms:\n $ \\alpha p(p-1)(p-2)(x - x^*)^{p-3} = \\alpha^4 p^4 (x - x^*)^{4p-4} $ \nEquating the powers and coefficients, we get:\n $ p - 3 = 4p - 4 $ \n $ p = 1 $ \n $ \\alpha(1-1)(1-2) = \\alpha^4 $ \nThis leads to a contradiction unless   $alpha = 0 $, which is not a meaningful solution. Thus, we need a different approach or numerical methods for large  $x $.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe analytical approximations for the solution at small  $x $ and large  $x $ (assuming a simpler form for large  $x $ due to complexity) are:\n $ \\boxed{[y = 1 - \\frac{x^3}{18}, y = \\text{Requires further analysis or numerical methods}]} $ \n\n and this ground truth         solution: The dominant balance in the small x regime is given by  $frac{d^{3}}{d x^{3}} y = \\frac{y}{20 x^{4} - 25 x^{3} + 25 x - 2},$  and the dominant balance in the large x regime is given by  $frac{d^{3}}{d x^{3}} y = \\left(\\frac{d}{d x} y\\right)^{4}$ \nUsing the dominant balance in the small x regime, the solution can be derived by     setting $x=0$, analytically solving the dominant balance equation     for y, and plugging in the initial conditions.
