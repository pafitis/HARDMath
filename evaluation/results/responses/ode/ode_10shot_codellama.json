Plugging in the ansatz and solving for the terms yields \n$ \n\\alpha p \\left(p - 2\\right) \\left(p - 1\\right) \\left(x - 10.7610761076108\\right)^{p - 3} = \\alpha^{4} p^{4} \\left(x - 10.7610761076108\\right)^{4 p - 4}\n$ \n\nAfter substituting the derivatives, the equation is reorganized to collect terms with respect to  $ (x - x^*)  $. This leads to an equation where the coefficients and powers of  $ (x - x^*)  $ are equated on both sides. Simplifying the equation gives us two separate equations, one for the coefficients and another for the powers of  $ (x - x^*)  $.\n\nThe coefficients' equation is:\n$ \n\\alpha p \\left(p - 2\\right) \\left(p - 1\\right) = \\alpha^{4} p^{4}\n$ \n\nThe powers' equation is:\n$ \np - 3 = 4 p - 4\n$ \n\nSolving this system of equations provides the values of  $ \\alpha  $ and  $ p  $. \nA valid solution is identified if  $ \\alpha  $ and  $ p  $ are both nonzero. \nIn such a case, the solution for  $ \\alpha  $ and  $ p  $ is found to be:\n$ \n\\alpha = \\sqrt[3]{30}, \\quad p = \\frac{1}{3}\n$ \n\nWith these values, the integration constant  $ C  $ is determined by substituting \na known point from the numerical solution into the ansatz. This yields the following equation for  $ C  $:\n$ \n1.42510002297165 = C - 0.448155413667484 \\cdot \\sqrt[3]{30}\n$ \n\nSolving this equation, we find the value of  $ C  $ to be:\n$ \nC = 2.81762309203845,\n$ \n\nso, the analytical approximation for the solution at large $x$ (near the divergence point) is given by\n$ \ny = \\sqrt[3]{30} (x - 10.7610761076108)^{\\frac{1}{3}} + (2.81762309203845),\n$ \n\nand the analytical approximation for the solution at small $x$ is given by\n$ \ny = 1 - \\frac{x^{3}}{24}.\n$ \n\nThus, the solution is given by \n $boxed{[y = 1 - \\frac{x^{3}}{24}, y = \\sqrt[3]{30} (x - 10.7610761076108)^{\\frac{1}{3}} + (2.81762309203845)]}$\n\n\nQuestion: Consider the following third-order ordinary differential equation:  $$y''' = \\frac{y}{8 \\left(x^{4} + 2 x^{2} - 3\\right)} + y'^{5} + \\frac{y''}{3 \\cdot \\left(2 x^{3} - 5 x^{2} - 1\\right)} + \\frac{1}{3 x^{4} - 4 x^{2} + 5 x + \\sin{\\left(x \\right)} - 3}$$\n\n\\text{with initial conditions at } x = 0:\n\\begin{align*}\ny(0) &= 1.00 \\\\\ny'(0) &= 0.00 \\\\\ny''(0) &= 0.00\n\\end{align*}\n\nFind analytical expressions that approximate the solution of $y(x)$ in the small $x$ and large $x$ regimes.\n\n\nHint: Please answer the question requiring two Python lists containing SymPy                 convertible formulas of variable $\\epsilon$ and math operation expressions and provide the                 final list e.g., $[\\epsilon^{3}, \\frac{1}{\\epsilon}]$ inside a Latex boxed format \\[boxed{}\\].\nSolution:",

3},$  and the dominant balance in the large x regime is given by  $frac{d^{3}}{d x^{3}} y = \\left(\\frac{d}{d x} y\\right)^{2}$ \nUsing the dominant balance in the small x regime, the solution can be derived by     setting $x=0$, analytically solving the dominant balance equation     for y, and plugging in the initial conditions. The solution is thus $ y{\\left(x \\right)} = 1 - \\frac{x^{3}}{12}$  in the small x regime.\n\nThe solution for the large  $ x  $ regime uses an ansatz of the form \n$  y = \\alpha (x - x^*)^p, $  \nwhere  $ x^*  $ is the divergence point. Plugging in the ansatz and solving for the terms yields \n$ \n\\alpha p \\left(p - 2\\right) \\left(p - 1\\right) \\left(x - 9.39093909390939\\right)^{p - 3} = \\alpha^{2} p^{2} \\left(x - 9.39093909390939\\right)^{2 p - 2}\n$ \n\nAfter substituting the derivatives, the equation is reorganized to collect terms with respect to  $ (x - x^*)  $. This leads to an equation where the coefficients and powers of  $ (x - x^*)  $ are equated on both sides. Simplifying the equation gives us two separate equations, one for the coefficients and another for the powers of  $ (x - x^*)  $.\n\nThe coefficients' equation is:\n$ \n\\alpha p \\left(p - 2\\right) \\left(p - 1\\right) = \\alpha^{2} p^{2}\n$ \n\nThe powers' equation is:\n$ \np - 3 = 2 p - 2\n$ \n\nSolving this system of equations provides the values of  $ \\alpha  $ and  $ p  $. \nA valid solution is identified if  $ \\alpha  $ and  $ p  $ are both nonzero. \nIn such a case, the solution for  $ \\alpha  $ and  $ p  $ is found to be:\n$ \n\\alpha = -6, \\quad p = -1\n$ \n\nWith these values, the integration constant  $ C  $ is determined by substituting \na known point from the numerical solution into the ansatz. This yields the following equation for  $ C  $:\n$ \n61.2446961654432 = C + 66.6599999999993\n$ \n\nSolving this equation, we find the value of  $ C  $ to be:\n$ \nC = -5.4153038345561,\n$ \n\nso, the analytical approximation for the solution at large $x$ (near the divergence point) is given by\n$ \ny = -6 (x - 9.39093909390939)^{-1} + (-5.4153038345561),\n$ \n\nand the analytical approximation for the solution at small $x$ is given by\n$ \ny = 1 - \\frac{x^{3}}{12}.\n$ \n\nThus, the solution is given by \n $boxed{[y = 1 - \\frac{x^{3}}{12}, y = -6 (x - 9.39093909390939)^{-1} + (-5.4153038345561)]}$ \n\n and grade the response based on the following criteria:\n\n1) Check both the small and large $\\epsilon$ solutions.         2) For each solution, give full credit if it matches the formula in the answer key;         give no credit if it is completely wrong and briefly state the reason for the error.         3) Average the scores for the small and large epsilon solutions to obtain a final score between 0 and 1.         4) Give the final grading as a float in Latex boxed format \\[boxed{}\\]",
