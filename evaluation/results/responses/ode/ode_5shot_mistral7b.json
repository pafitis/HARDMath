        "response": " To find analytical expressions that approximate the solution of `y(x)` in the small `x` and large `x` regimes, we will follow a similar approach as in the previous example.\n\n1. Find the dominant balance equations for small `x` and large `x`.\n2. Solve these equations to obtain expressions for `y(x)` in each regime.\n3. Use the given initial conditions to determine the integration constants.\n\nLet's start by finding the dominant balance equations:\n\n1. Small `x` regime: The dominant term is $y''' = - \\frac{y}{2 x^{3} + 5 x + 4}$. We can approximate this as $\\epsilon^3 y''' = -\\frac{y}{\\epsilon^3}$, where $\\epsilon$ represents a small quantity.\n\n2. Large `x` regime: The dominant terms are $y''' = y'^{4}$ and $y''' = \\frac{y''}{x^{3} - 3 x^{2} - 5}$. We can approximate this as $\\epsilon^0 y''' = y'^{4}$ and $\\epsilon^{-3} y''' = \\frac{y''}{\\epsilon^{-3}}$, where $\\epsilon$ represents a large quantity.\n\nNow, let's solve these equations:\n\n1. Small `x` regime: We have the equation $\\epsilon^3 y''' = -\\frac{y}{\\epsilon^3}$. Integrating this three times and using the given initial conditions, we get:\n\n   $y(x) = 1 + \\frac{x^{3}}{6} - \\frac{\\epsilon^3}{24} x^4$\n\n   Note that we have introduced an integration constant $\\frac{\\epsilon^3}{24}$ to account for the arbitrary function of `x` in our solution.\n\n2. Large `x` regime: We have two equations, one for $y'''$ and another for $y''$. Integrating each equation twice and using the given initial conditions, we get:\n\n   $y(x) = \\frac{1}{2} x^2 + C_1 x + C_2 - \\frac{\\epsilon^{-3}}{6} x^4$\n\n   Here, we have introduced two integration constants $C_1$ and $C_2$ to account for the arbitrary functions of `x` in our solution.\n\nNow, let's determine the integration constants:\n\nWe know that both solutions should match at some point, so we can set them equal to each other and solve for $\\epsilon$. We get:\n\n   $1 + \\frac{x^{3}}{6} - \\frac{\\epsilon^3}{24} x^4 = \\frac{1}{2} x^2 + C_1 x + C_2 - \\frac{\\epsilon^{-3}}{6} x^4$\n\n   Solving this equation for $\\epsilon$, we find that $\\epsilon = 1$.\n\nNow, let's determine the integration constants $C_1$ and $C_2$:\n\nWe know that both solutions should have the same first derivative at `x=0`.

        "grade_prompt": "Please take this response:  To find analytical expressions that approximate the solution of `y(x)` in the small `x` and large `x` regimes, we will follow a similar approach as in the previous example.\n\n1. Find the dominant balance equations for small `x` and large `x`.\n2. Solve these equations to obtain expressions for `y(x)` in each regime.\n3. Use the given initial conditions to determine the integration constants.\n\nLet's start by finding the dominant balance equations:\n\n1. Small `x` regime: The dominant term is $y''' = - \\frac{y}{2 x^{3} + 5 x + 4}$. We can approximate this as  $epsilon^3 y''' = -\\frac{y}{\\epsilon^3}$, where  $epsilon$ represents a small quantity.\n\n2. Large `x` regime: The dominant terms are $y''' = y'^{4}$ and $y''' = \\frac{y''}{x^{3} - 3 x^{2} - 5}$. We can approximate this as  $epsilon^0 y''' = y'^{4}$ and  $epsilon^{-3} y''' = \\frac{y''}{\\epsilon^{-3}}$, where  $epsilon$ represents a large quantity.\n\nNow, let's solve these equations:\n\n1. Small `x` regime: We have the equation  $epsilon^3 y''' = -\\frac{y}{\\epsilon^3}$. Integrating this three times and using the given initial conditions, we get:\n\n   $y(x) = 1 + \\frac{x^{3}}{6} - \\frac{\\epsilon^3}{24} x^4$\n\n   Note that we have introduced an integration constant  $frac{\\epsilon^3}{24}$ to account for the arbitrary function of `x` in our solution.\n\n2. Large `x` regime: We have two equations, one for $y'''$ and another for $y''$. Integrating each equation twice and using the given initial conditions, we get:\n\n   $y(x) = \\frac{1}{2} x^2 + C_1 x + C_2 - \\frac{\\epsilon^{-3}}{6} x^4$\n\n   Here, we have introduced two integration constants $C_1$ and $C_2$ to account for the arbitrary functions of `x` in our solution.\n\nNow, let's determine the integration constants:\n\nWe know that both solutions should match at some point, so we can set them equal to each other and solve for  $epsilon$. We get:\n\n   $1 + \\frac{x^{3}}{6} - \\frac{\\epsilon^3}{24} x^4 = \\frac{1}{2} x^2 + C_1 x + C_2 - \\frac{\\epsilon^{-3}}{6} x^4$\n\n   Solving this equation for  $epsilon$, we find that  $epsilon = 1$.\n\nNow, let's determine the integration constants $C_1$ and $C_2$:\n\nWe know that both solutions should have the same first derivative at `x=0`. So, we can set the derivatives equal to each other and solve for $C_1$. We get:\n\n   $0 = C_1 + 0 - \\frac{\\epsilon^{-3}}{6} (0)^4$\n\n   Solving this equation for $C_1$, we find that $C_1 = 0$.\n\nNext, let's determine the second derivative of the large `x` solution at `x=0`. We get:\n\n   $y''(0) = C_2$\n\n   Since we know that $y''(0) = 0$, we find that $C_2 = 0$.\n\nNow, let's determine the integration constants in terms of  $epsilon$:\n\nWe can rewrite the small `x` solution as:\n\n   $y(x) = 1 + \\frac{x^{3}}{6} - \\frac{\\epsilon^3}{24} x^4$\n\n   Since we found that  $epsilon = 1$, this simplifies to:\n\n   $y(x) = 1 + \\frac{x^{3}}{6} - \\frac{x^4}{24}$\n\nSimilarly, we can rewrite the large `x` solution as:\n\n   $y(x) = \\frac{1}{2} x^2 + C_1 x + C_2$\n\n   Since we found that $C_1 = 0$ and $C_2 = 0$, this simplifies to:\n\n   $y(x) = \\frac{1}{2} x^2$\n\nFinally, let's present the results in a LaTeX format:\n\nThe small `x` solution is given by:\n $boxed{\\begin{aligned}\ny(x) &= 1 + \\frac{x^{3}}{6} - \\frac{x^4}{24} \\\\\n\\end{aligned}}$ \n\nThe large `x` solution is given by:\n $boxed{\\begin{aligned}\ny(x) &= \\frac{1}{2} x^2 \\\\\n\\end{aligned}}$ \n\n and this ground truth         solution: The dominant balance in the small x regime is given by  $frac{d^{3}}{d x^{3}} y = - \\frac{y}{2 x^{3} + 5 x + 4},$  and the dominant balance in the large x regime is given by  $frac{d^{3}}{d x^{3}} y = \\left(\\frac{d}{d x} y\\right)^{4}$ \nUsing the dominant balance in the small x regime, the solution can be derived by     setting $x=0$, analytically solving the dominant balance equation     for y, and plugging in the initial conditions.

The final answer will be a list containing the expressions for  $epsilon$ and math operations in LaTeX format:\n\n```python\nfinal_answer = r' $boxed{\\begin{cases} y(x) \\approx ' + ', '.join([str(expr).replace('_', '\\_') for expr in small_x_regime]) + ', \\\\ y(x) \\approx ' + ', '.join([str(expr).replace('_', '\\_') for expr in large_x_regime]) + '}$ '\n```\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n```python\nfinal_answer = r' $boxed{\\begin{cases} y(x) \\approx epsilon^{3}, -1/(5*epsilon^{2} + 1), \\\\ y(x) \\approx (Derivative(y, x, 3))^{5}, Derivative(y, x, 2)/(6 * (2*x^{4} - 1)), e^{-x}\\end{cases}}$ '\n```\n\n and this ground truth         solution: The dominant balance in the small x regime is given by  $frac{d^{3}}{d x^{3}} y = - \\frac{y}{5 x^{2} + 1},$  and the dominant balance in the large x regime is given by  $frac{d^{3}}{d x^{3}} y = \\left(\\frac{d}{d x} y\\right)^{5}$ \nUsing the dominant balance in the small x regime, the solution can be derived by     setting $x=0$, analytically solving the dominant balance equation     for y, and plugging in the initial conditions. The solution is thus $ y{\\left(x \\right)} = 1 - \\frac{x^{3}}{6}$  in the small x regime.\n\nThe solution for the large  $ x  $ regime uses an ansatz of the form \n$  y = \\alpha (x - x^*)^p, $  \nwhere  $ x^*  $ is the divergence point.

We will also find the integration constant `C` using a known point from the numerical solution:\n\n```python\nlarge_x_solution = {key: value.subs(epsilon, S(1/1e3)) for key, value in large_x_solution.items()}\nC = simplify((y(0) - large_x_solution[y]) / large_x_solution[y_prime.coeff(1/epsilon)])\n```\n\nFinally, we can present the solutions for small and large `x` in a more readable format:\n\n```python\nsmall_x_solution_str = ', '.join([f'{key}: {value}' for key, value in small_x_solution.items()])\nlarge_x_solution_str = ', '.join([f'{key}: {value}' for key, value in large_x_solution.items()])\nprint(f\"Solutions for small x: y = {small_x_solution_str}, y' = {y_prime.subs(small_x_solution).expr()}, y'' = {y_double_prime.subs(small_x_solution).expr()}\")\nprint(f\"Solutions for large x: y = {large_x_solution_str}, y' = {y_prime.subs(large_x_solution).expr()}, y'' = {y_double_prime.subs(large_x_solution).expr()}\")\n```\n\nThis code will give you the solutions for small and large `x` in terms of `epsilon`. You can then substitute a specific value for `epsilon` to get the approximate solutions for those regions.\n\n and this ground truth         solution: The dominant balance in the small x regime is given by  $frac{d^{3}}{d x^{3}} y = \\frac{y}{9 x^{3} + 9 x - 2},$  and the dominant balance in the large x regime is given by  $frac{d^{3}}{d x^{3}} y = \\left(\\frac{d}{d x} y\\right)^{4}$ \nUsing the dominant balance in the small x regime, the solution can be derived by     setting $x=0$, analytically solving the dominant balance equation     for y, and plugging in the initial conditions.

        "response": " To find analytical expressions that approximate the solution of `y(x)` in the small `x` and large `x` regimes, we will follow a similar approach as in the previous example.\n\nFirst, let's define the dominant balance equations for both regimes:\n\n1. Small `x` regime:\n   The dominant balance equation is given by setting the term with the highest power of `x` to be equal to zero:\n   ```python\n   small_x_dominant = y''' + y / (20 * x**3 + 10 * x**2 - 5 * x + 3)\n   ```\n\n2. Large `x` regime:\n   We will assume that the solution behaves as `A e^(-x)` for large `x`. To find the coefficients, we can set the terms with the lowest power of `x` to be equal to zero:\n   ```python\n   large_x_dominant = y''' - 3 - 2 * exp(-x) + (y'') / (15 * x**3 - 3 * x - 2)\n   ```\n\nNow, let's define the small `x` and large `x` approximations:\n\n1. Small `x` approximation:\n   We will use a Taylor series expansion for `y(x)` around `x=0`. The first three terms of the expansion are sufficient for our purposes:\n   ```python\n   small_x_approx = y(x).series(x, 3)\n   ```\n\n2.

We can solve these equations to find the values of  $alpha$,  $beta$, and $x_0$. Once we have those values, we can write down the expressions for `y(x)` in both regimes.\n\nTo make this solution more compact, let's define a Python list containing the variables and operations for each regime:\n\n```python\nsmall_x_regime = [('alpha', 'beta', 'beta - 1', 'beta - 2'), (1/(x_0)**2 + 3), '=']\nlarge_x_regime = [('alpha', 'beta', 'beta - 1', 'beta - 2', '(x - x_0)'), (1, -1, -1, -1, '/', 15*(x_0)**2 - 15*x_0 + 4), '-', 1, -6*(x_0)**4 - 12*(x_0)**3 + np.sin(x_0) - 3]\n```\n\nFinally, we can write down the expressions for `y(x)` in both regimes using SymPy:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve, latex\n\nx, x_0 = symbols('x x_0')\nalpha, beta = symbols('alpha beta')\nsmall_x_equation = Eq(*small_x_regime).subs(x_0, x_0)\nlarge_x_equation = Eq(*large_x_regime).subs(x_0, x_0)\nsoln = solve((small_x_equation, large_x_equation), (alpha, beta))\nprint('Small x regime: y(x) =', latex(sympify(y'(x).subs(soln[0]))))\nprint('Large x regime: y(x) =', latex(sympify(y'(x).subs(soln[1]))))\n```\n\nThis code will give you the expressions for `y(x)` in both regimes, which can be further simplified if desired.\n\n and this ground truth         solution: The dominant balance in the small x regime is given by  $frac{d^{3}}{d x^{3}} y = - \\frac{1}{6 x^{4} + 12 x^{3} - \\sin{\\left(x \\right)} + 3},$  and the dominant balance in the large x regime is given by  $frac{d^{3}}{d x^{3}} y = \\left(\\frac{d}{d x} y\\right)^{2}$ \nUsing the dominant balance in the small x regime, the solution can be derived by     setting $x=0$, analytically solving the dominant balance equation     for y, and plugging in the initial conditions. The solution is thus $ y{\\left(x \\right)} = 1 - \\frac{x^{3}}{18}$  in the small x regime.\n\nThe solution for the large  $ x  $ regime uses an ansatz of the form \n$  y = \\alpha (x - x^*)^p, $  \nwhere  $ x^*  $ is the divergence point.

However, to make this solution more general, we will introduce a small parameter `\u03b5` such that `x = \u03b5x_0`. This way, our solutions will be valid for both small and large `x`.\n\nNow, let's define the SymPy expressions for each regime:\n\n1.

For this, we'll assume that `y`, `y_prime`, and `y_double_prime` are of order 1 (large `x`) and find expressions for each term in terms of `(x - x0)`.\n\n```python\nterms = [(y / ((6 * x**4 + 9 * x + 18))), (y_prime**2), (y_double_prime / ((6 * x**4 + 10 * x + 3))), (1 / ((4 * x**4 + 3 * x**3 + cos(x) - 3)))]\nlarge_x_expressions = [simplify(terms[i].subs(x, x0).subs(diff(x, x), 1).subs(diff(y(x), x, 2), 1) for i in terms) for x0 in [0, 22.2022202220222]]\n```\n\nNow, we will solve the differential equation for large `x` near the divergence point (x = 22.2022202220222). We'll assume that `y`, `y_prime`, and `y_double_prime` are of order `\u03b5` (small `(x - x0)`) and find expressions for each term in terms of `(x - x0)`.\n\n```python\nepsilon = symbols('\u03b5')\nterms = [(y / ((6 * (x - 22.2022202220222)**4 + 9 * (x - 22.2022202220222) + 18) * epsilon)), (y_prime**2), (y_double_prime / ((6 * (x - 22.2022202220222)**4 + 10 * (x - 22.2022202220222) + 3) * epsilon)), (1 / ((4 * (x - 22.2022202220222)**4 + 3 * (x - 22.2022202220222)**3 + cos(x) - 3) * epsilon))]\nlarge_x_near_divergence_expressions = [simplify(terms[i].subs(x, 22.2022202220222).subs(diff(x, x), 1).subs(diff(y(x), x, 2), 1) for i in terms)]\n```\n\nFinally, we will solve the system of equations to find expressions for `y`, `y_prime`, and `y_double_prime` in terms of `\u03b5`.\n\n```python\nsmall_x_solution = solve(small_x_expressions, [y, y_prime, y_double_prime])\nlarge_x_solution = solve(large_x_expressions[0], [y, y_prime, y_double_prime])\nlarge_x_near_divergence_solution = solve(large_x_near_divergence_expressions, [y, y_prime, y_double_prime])\n```\n\nNow we have the solutions for small `x`, large `x`, and large `x` near the divergence point. We can use these expressions to find the approximate behavior of the solution as `x` approaches 0 or becomes very large.\n\n```python\nprint(\"Small x approximation:\")\nfor sol in small_x_solution:\n    print(sol)\n\nprint(\"\\nLarge x approximation (far from divergence point):\")\nfor sol in large_x_solution[0]:\n    print(sol)\n\nprint(\"\\nLarge x approximation near the divergence point:\")\nfor sol in large_x_near_divergence_solution[0]:\n    print(sol)\n```\n\n and this ground truth         solution: The dominant balance in the small x regime is given by  $frac{d^{3}}{d x^{3}} y = \\frac{1}{4 x^{4} + 3 x^{3} + \\cos{\\left(x \\right)} - 3},$  and the dominant balance in the large x regime is given by  $frac{d^{3}}{d x^{3}} y = \\left(\\frac{d}{d x} y\\right)^{2}$ \nUsing the dominant balance in the small x regime, the solution can be derived by     setting $x=0$, analytically solving the dominant balance equation     for y, and plugging in the initial conditions.
