        "response": " To find analytical expressions that approximate the solution of `y(x)` in the small `x` and large `x` regimes, we will follow a similar approach as in the previous example.\n\n1. Find the dominant balance equations for small `x` and large `x`.\n2. Solve these equations to obtain expressions for `y(x)` in each regime.\n3. Use the given initial conditions to determine the integration constants.\n\nLet's start by finding the dominant balance equations:\n\n1. Small `x` regime: The dominant term is $y''' = - \\frac{y}{2 x^{3} + 5 x + 4}$. We can approximate this as $\\epsilon^3 y''' = -\\frac{y}{\\epsilon^3}$, where $\\epsilon$ represents a small quantity.\n\n2. Large `x` regime: The dominant terms are $y''' = y'^{4}$ and $y''' = \\frac{y''}{x^{3} - 3 x^{2} - 5}$. We can approximate this as $\\epsilon^0 y''' = y'^{4}$ and $\\epsilon^{-3} y''' = \\frac{y''}{\\epsilon^{-3}}$, where $\\epsilon$ represents a large quantity.\n\nNow, let's solve these equations:\n\n1. Small `x` regime: We have the equation $\\epsilon^3 y''' = -\\frac{y}{\\epsilon^3}$. Integrating this three times and using the given initial conditions, we get:\n\n   $y(x) = 1 + \\frac{x^{3}}{6} - \\frac{\\epsilon^3}{24} x^4$\n\n   Note that we have introduced an integration constant $\\frac{\\epsilon^3}{24}$ to account for the arbitrary function of `x` in our solution.\n\n2. Large `x` regime: We have two equations, one for $y'''$ and another for $y''$. Integrating each equation twice and using the given initial conditions, we get:\n\n   $y(x) = \\frac{1}{2} x^2 + C_1 x + C_2 - \\frac{\\epsilon^{-3}}{6} x^4$\n\n   Here, we have introduced two integration constants $C_1$ and $C_2$ to account for the arbitrary functions of `x` in our solution.\n\nNow, let's determine the integration constants:\n\nWe know that both solutions should match at some point, so we can set them equal to each other and solve for $\\epsilon$. We get:\n\n   $1 + \\frac{x^{3}}{6} - \\frac{\\epsilon^3}{24} x^4 = \\frac{1}{2} x^2 + C_1 x + C_2 - \\frac{\\epsilon^{-3}}{6} x^4$\n\n   Solving this equation for $\\epsilon$, we find that $\\epsilon = 1$.\n\nNow, let's determine the integration constants $C_1$ and $C_2$:\n\nWe know that both solutions should have the same first derivative at `x=0`.

        "grade_prompt": "Please take this response:  To find analytical expressions that approximate the solution of `y(x)` in the small `x` and large `x` regimes, we will follow a similar approach as in the previous example.\n\n1. Find the dominant balance equations for small `x` and large `x`.\n2. Solve these equations to obtain expressions for `y(x)` in each regime.\n3. Use the given initial conditions to determine the integration constants.\n\nLet's start by finding the dominant balance equations:\n\n1. Small `x` regime: The dominant term is $y''' = - \\frac{y}{2 x^{3} + 5 x + 4}$. We can approximate this as  $epsilon^3 y''' = -\\frac{y}{\\epsilon^3}$, where  $epsilon$ represents a small quantity.\n\n2.

Large `x` regime: We have two equations, one for $y'''$ and another for $y''$. Integrating each equation twice and using the given initial conditions, we get:\n\n   $y(x) = \\frac{1}{2} x^2 + C_1 x + C_2 - \\frac{\\epsilon^{-3}}{6} x^4$\n\n   Here, we have introduced two integration constants $C_1$ and $C_2$ to account for the arbitrary functions of `x` in our solution.\n\nNow, let's determine the integration constants:\n\nWe know that both solutions should match at some point, so we can set them equal to each other and solve for  $epsilon$. We get:\n\n   $1 + \\frac{x^{3}}{6} - \\frac{\\epsilon^3}{24} x^4 = \\frac{1}{2} x^2 + C_1 x + C_2 - \\frac{\\epsilon^{-3}}{6} x^4$\n\n   Solving this equation for  $epsilon$, we find that  $epsilon = 1$.\n\nNow, let's determine the integration constants $C_1$ and $C_2$:\n\nWe know that both solutions should have the same first derivative at `x=0`. So, we can set the derivatives equal to each other and solve for $C_1$. We get:\n\n   $0 = C_1 + 0 - \\frac{\\epsilon^{-3}}{6} (0)^4$\n\n   Solving this equation for $C_1$, we find that $C_1 = 0$.\n\nNext, let's determine the second derivative of the large `x` solution at `x=0`.

We will also find the integration constant `C` using a known point from the numerical solution:\n\n```python\nsmall_x_solution = {key: value.subs(epsilon, S(1e-3)) for key, value in small_x_solution.items()}\nC = simplify((y(0) - small_x_solution[y]) / small_x_solution[y_prime.coeff(epsilon)])\n```\n\nNext, we will solve the differential equation for large `x`. For this, we assume that `y`, `y'`, and `y''` are of order `O(1/epsilon)`, where `epsilon` is a small parameter:\n\n```python\nlarge_x_coefficients = [y, y_prime, y_double_prime, y_triple_prime]\nlarge_x_powers = [-3, -2, -1, 0]\nlarge_x_eqs = []\nfor i in range(len(large_x_coefficients)):\n    large_x_eqs.append(Eq(large_x_coefficients[i], sum([c * epsilon**p for p, c in zip(large_x_powers, [0, 1, 2, 3]) if i >= p])))\n```\n\nSimplify the equations and solve for `epsilon` and the coefficients:\n\n```python\nlarge_x_eqs = [simplify(eq) for eq in large_x_eqs]\nlarge_x_solution = solve(large_x_eqs, [epsilon, y.coeff(1/epsilon), y_prime.coeff(1/epsilon), y_double_prime.coeff(1/epsilon)])\n```\n\nNow, we can express the solutions for large `x` in terms of `epsilon`. We will also find the integration constant `C` using a known point from the numerical solution:\n\n```python\nlarge_x_solution = {key: value.subs(epsilon, S(1/1e3)) for key, value in large_x_solution.items()}\nC = simplify((y(0) - large_x_solution[y]) / large_x_solution[y_prime.coeff(1/epsilon)])\n```\n\nFinally, we can present the solutions for small and large `x` in a more readable format:\n\n```python\nsmall_x_solution_str = ', '.join([f'{key}: {value}' for key, value in small_x_solution.items()])\nlarge_x_solution_str = ', '.join([f'{key}: {value}' for key, value in large_x_solution.items()])\nprint(f\"Solutions for small x: y = {small_x_solution_str}, y' = {y_prime.subs(small_x_solution).expr()}, y'' = {y_double_prime.subs(small_x_solution).expr()}\")\nprint(f\"Solutions for large x: y = {large_x_solution_str}, y' = {y_prime.subs(large_x_solution).expr()}, y'' = {y_double_prime.subs(large_x_solution).expr()}\")\n```\n\nThis code will give you the solutions for small and large `x` in terms of `epsilon`. You can then substitute a specific value for `epsilon` to get the approximate solutions for those regions.\n\n and this ground truth         solution: The dominant balance in the small x regime is given by  $frac{d^{3}}{d x^{3}} y = \\frac{y}{9 x^{3} + 9 x - 2},$  and the dominant balance in the large x regime is given by  $frac{d^{3}}{d x^{3}} y = \\left(\\frac{d}{d x} y\\right)^{4}$ \nUsing the dominant balance in the small x regime, the solution can be derived by     setting $x=0$, analytically solving the dominant balance equation     for y, and plugging in the initial conditions.

        "response": " To find analytical expressions that approximate the solution of `y(x)` in the small `x` and large `x` regimes, we will follow a similar approach as in the previous example.\n\nFirst, let's define the dominant balance equations for both regimes:\n\n1. Small x regime:\n   The dominant balance equation is given by $y''' = - \\frac{y}{16 x + 5}$.\n\n2. Large x regime:\n   We will use an ansatz of the form $y = \\alpha (x - x^*)^p$, where $x^*$ is a constant to be determined later. After substituting derivatives, we get an equation similar to the previous example.\n\nNow, let's define the SymPy expressions for both regimes:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Function, diff, Eq, solve\nx = symbols('x')\ny = Function('y')(x)\nepsilon = symbols('\u03b5', positive=True)\n\n# Small x regime\nsmall_x_eqs = [Eq(diff(y(x), x, 3), - y(x)/(16*x + 5))]\n\n# Large x regime\nlarge_x_eqs = []\nfor p in range(1, 4):\n    large_x_eqs.append(Eq(diff(y(x), x, p), 0))\nlarge_x_eqs.append(Eq(y(x), alpha*((x - x_star)**p)))\n\n# Constants and coefficients\ncoefficients = [alpha, p]\npowers = [(x - x_star)] * p + [1]\n```\n\nNow we can solve the large `x` regime equations to find the values of `\u03b1` and `p`.

        "response": "1. To find analytical expressions that approximate the solution of `y(x)` in the small `x` and large `x` regimes, we will follow a similar approach as in the previous example.\n\n2. First, let's identify the dominant balance terms for each regime:\n   - Small x regime: The dominant balance is given by $frac{d^{3}}{d x^{3}} y = - \\frac{y}{3 x^{2} + 5}$.\n   - Large x regime: The dominant balance is given by $frac{d^{3}}{d x^{3}} y = e^{-x}$.\n\n3. Now, let's derive the solutions for each regime:\n\n4. Small `x` regime solution:\n   - Solve the ODE for small `x` using a Taylor series expansion around `x=0`.\n   - The general form of the Taylor series is $sum_{n=0}^{infty} frac{y^{(n)}(0)}{n!} x^n$.\n   - Here, we have $y(0)=1$, $y'(0)=0$ and $y''(0)=0$. So, the Taylor series expansion for small `x` is:\n     y(x) = 1 + sum_{n=3}^{infty} frac{y^{(n)}(0)}{n!} x^n\n\n5. Large `x` regime solution:\n   - Solve the ODE for large `x` using an exponential function.\n   - The general form of the solution is $A e^{lambda x}$, where A and lambda are constants to be determined.\n   - Here, we have $y(0)=1$, $y'(0)=0$ and $y''(0)=0$.

Large `x` regime:\n   - Integrate the approximation twice to obtain a first-order ODE:  $int y'' dx + \\frac{1}{25 x^2} \\int y' dx = -\\int e^{-x} dx$\n   - This equation has a solution of the form $y(x) = C_1 x + C_2 e^{x} + \\frac{3}{25} x^2 e^{x}$. Using the initial conditions, we find that $C_1=0$ and $C_2=1 - \\frac{3}{25}$. So, the solution in the large `x` regime is $y(x) = (1 - \\frac{3}{25}) e^{x} + \\frac{3}{25} x^2 e^{x}$.\n\nNow that we have expressions for `y(x)` in each regime, let's find the integration constants:\n\n- In the small `x` regime, the constant is $A=1$.\n- In the large `x` regime, we can use a known point from the numerical solution to determine the constant. Let's say that at some large value of `x`, the numerical solution gives us $y(X) = Y$. Then, we have the equation: $(1 - \\frac{3}{25}) X + \\frac{3}{25} X^2 = Y$. Solving this equation for $C_2$ will give us the constant in the large `x` regime.\n\nFinally, let's present our results using SymPy expressions:\n\n```python\n# Small x regime\nsmall_x_regime = sympy.Function('y')(x)\nsmall_x_regime_expression = sympy.cos(sympy.Sqrt(2)*x)\n\n# Large x regime\nlarge_x_regime = sympy.Function('y')(x)\nlarge_x_regime_expression = (1 - 3/25) * sympy.exp(x) + (3/25) * x**2 * sympy.exp(x)\n```\n\nTo find the constant in the large `x` regime, we can use a numerical method or solve the equation for $C_2$ analytically if possible. The final expression for `y(x)` will be:\n\n```python\n# Final solution\nfinal_solution = sympy.latex(sympy.Piecewise((small_x_regime_expression, x < X), (large_x_regime_expression, True)))\nprint(final_solution)\n```\n\nThis will give us the final expression for `y(x)` in LaTeX format:\n\n$ \n\\begin{cases}\n\\cos(\\frac{x^2}{2}) & x < X \\\\\n(1 - \\frac{3}{25}) e^{x} + \\frac{3}{25} x^2 e^{x} & x \\geq X\n\\end{cases}\n$ \n\n and this ground truth         solution: The dominant balance in the small x regime is given by  $frac{d^{3}}{d x^{3}} y = \\frac{y}{6 x^{3} + 6 x - 1},$  and the dominant balance in the large x regime is given by  $frac{d^{3}}{d x^{3}} y = \\left(\\frac{d}{d x} y\\right)^{4}$ \nUsing the dominant balance in the small x regime, the solution can be derived by     setting $x=0$, analytically solving the dominant balance equation     for y, and plugging in the initial conditions. The solution is thus $ y{\\left(x \\right)} = 1 - \\frac{x^{3}}{6}$  in the small x regime.\n\nThe solution for the large  $ x  $ regime uses an ansatz of the form \n$  y = \\alpha (x - x^*)^p, $  \nwhere  $ x^*  $ is the divergence point.
