Assuming a solution of the form  $y = \\alpha x^p $, we find:\n $ y' = \\alpha p x^{p-1}, \\quad y'' = \\alpha p (p-1) x^{p-2}, \\quad y''' = \\alpha p (p-1)(p-2) x^{p-3} $ \n $ y'^4 = \\alpha^4 p^4 x^{4p-4} $ \nEquating the leading terms:\n $ \\alpha p (p-1)(p-2) x^{p-3} = \\alpha^4 p^4 x^{4p-4} $ \nThis leads to:\n $ p - 3 = 4p - 4 \\Rightarrow p = 1 $ \n $ \\alpha (1-1)(1-2) = \\alpha^4 \\Rightarrow \\text{no solution for } \\alpha \\text{ as } p = 1 \\text{ leads to zero in the coefficient} $ \n\nThus, for large  $x $, the solution behavior is not straightforward to determine analytically without further assumptions or simplifications.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe analytical expressions for the solution in the small  $x $ and large  $x $ regimes are:\n $ \\boxed{[y = 1 - \\frac{x^3}{30}, \\text{ large } x \\text{ behavior not determined analytically}]} $ \n\n and this ground truth         solution: The dominant balance in the small x regime is given by  $frac{d^{3}}{d x^{3}} y = \\frac{y}{2 \\left(x^{4} - 3 x^{2} - 1\\right)},$  and the dominant balance in the large x regime is given by  $frac{d^{3}}{d x^{3}} y = \\left(\\frac{d}{d x} y\\right)^{4}$ \nUsing the dominant balance in the small x regime, the solution can be derived by     setting $x=0$, analytically solving the dominant balance equation     for y, and plugging in the initial conditions.

The solution is thus $ y{\\left(x \\right)} = 1 - \\frac{x^{3}}{24}$  in the small x regime.\n\nThe solution for the large  $ x  $ regime uses an ansatz of the form \n$  y = \\alpha (x - x^*)^p, $  \nwhere  $ x^*  $ is the divergence point.

This leads to a balance of terms and solving for  $p $ and   $alpha $ under the assumption that the leading terms balance each other.\n\n### Final Expressions\nThe analytical expressions for small and large  $x $ regimes are:\n $ \\text{Small } x: y(x) \\approx 1 - e^{-x} - \\frac{x^2}{2} $ \n $ \\text{Large } x: y(x) \\approx \\alpha x^p \\text{ (with specific } \\alpha \\text{ and } p \\text{ determined by balancing terms)} $ \n\n### Python Lists for SymPy Conversion\nFor small  $x $:\n $ \\left[1, -e^{-x}, -\\frac{x^2}{2}\\right] $ \n\nFor large  $x $:\n $ \\left[\\alpha, x^p\\right] $ \n\n### Boxed Output\n $\n\\boxed{[\\left[1, -e^{-x}, -\\frac{x^2}{2}\\right], \\left[\\alpha, x^p\\right]]}\n$ \n\n and this ground truth         solution: The dominant balance in the small x regime is given by  $frac{d^{3}}{d x^{3}} y = e^{- x},$  and the dominant balance in the large x regime is given by  $frac{d^{3}}{d x^{3}} y = \\left(\\frac{d}{d x} y\\right)^{2}$ \nUsing the dominant balance in the small x regime, the solution can be derived by     setting $x=0$, analytically solving the dominant balance equation     for y, and plugging in the initial conditions.

Here, the dominant term is  $y'^5 $:\n $ y''' \\approx y'^5 $ \n\nAssuming a solution of the form  $y = \\alpha x^p $, we substitute and equate the powers and coefficients:\n $ \\alpha p(p-1)(p-2)x^{p-3} = \\alpha^5 p^5 x^{5p-5} $ \n\nEquating the powers:\n $ p - 3 = 5p - 5 $ \n $ 4p = 2 $ \n $ p = \\frac{1}{2} $ \n\nSubstituting  $p = \\frac{1}{2} $ back, we find:\n $ \\alpha = \\left(\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\left(\\frac{1}{2} - 1\\right) \\cdot \\left(\\frac{1}{2} - 2\\right)\\right)^{1/4} $ \n $ \\alpha = \\left(-\\frac{3}{8}\\right)^{1/4} $ \n\nThus, the solution in the large  $x $ regime is:\n $ y = \\left(-\\frac{3}{8}\\right)^{1/4} x^{1/2} $ \n\n### Final Answer\nThe analytical expressions for the solution in the small  $x $ and large  $x $ regimes are:\n $ \\boxed{[y = 1 - \\frac{x^3}{27}, y = \\left(-\\frac{3}{8}\\right)^{1/4} x^{1/2}]} $ \n\n and this ground truth         solution: The dominant balance in the small x regime is given by  $frac{d^{3}}{d x^{3}} y = \\frac{y}{x^{2} + 4 x - 1},$  and the dominant balance in the large x regime is given by  $frac{d^{3}}{d x^{3}} y = \\left(\\frac{d}{d x} y\\right)^{5}$ \nUsing the dominant balance in the small x regime, the solution can be derived by     setting $x=0$, analytically solving the dominant balance equation     for y, and plugging in the initial conditions.

The equation simplifies to:\n $ y''' \\approx y'^4 $ \n\nAssuming a solution of the form  $y = \\alpha (x - x^*)^p $, where  $x^* $ is a large value and substituting  $y' $,  $y'' $, and  $y''' $ into the equation, we get:\n $ \\alpha p(p-1)(p-2)(x-x^*)^{p-3} = \\alpha^4 p^4 (x-x^*)^{4p-4} $ \n\nBalancing the powers and coefficients, we find:\n $ p - 3 = 4p - 4 $ \n $ p = \\frac{1}{3} $ \n\nThe coefficient balance gives:\n $ \\alpha \\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)\\left(-\\frac{2}{3}\\right)\\left(-\\frac{5}{3}\\right) = \\alpha^4 \\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)^4 $ \n $ \\alpha = \\sqrt[3]{30} $ \n\nThus, the solution in the large  $x $ regime is:\n $ y = \\sqrt[3]{30} (x - x^*)^{\\frac{1}{3}} $ \n\n### Final Answer\nThe analytical approximations for the solution at small  $x $ and large  $x $ are:\n $ \\boxed{[y = 1 - \\frac{19x^3}{360}, y = \\sqrt[3]{30} (x - x^*)^{\\frac{1}{3}}]} $ \n\n and this ground truth         solution: The dominant balance in the small x regime is given by  $frac{d^{3}}{d x^{3}} y = \\frac{1}{3 x^{4} - x + \\sin{\\left(x \\right)} - 4},$  and the dominant balance in the large x regime is given by  $frac{d^{3}}{d x^{3}} y = \\left(\\frac{d}{d x} y\\right)^{4}$ \nUsing the dominant balance in the small x regime, the solution can be derived by     setting $x=0$, analytically solving the dominant balance equation     for y, and plugging in the initial conditions. The solution is thus $ y{\\left(x \\right)} = 1 - \\frac{x^{3}}{24}$  in the small x regime.\n\nThe solution for the large  $ x  $ regime uses an ansatz of the form \n$  y = \\alpha (x - x^*)^p, $  \nwhere  $ x^*  $ is the divergence point.

This leads to an equation where the coefficients and powers of  $ (x - x^*)  $ are equated on both sides. Simplifying the equation gives us two separate equations, one for the coefficients and another for the powers of  $ (x - x^*)  $.\n\nThe coefficients' equation is:\n$ \n\\alpha p \\left(p - 2\\right) \\left(p - 1\\right) = \\alpha^{2} p^{2}\n$ \n\nThe powers' equation is:\n$ \np - 3 = 2 p - 2\n$ \n\nSolving this system of equations provides the values of  $ \\alpha  $ and  $ p  $. \nA valid solution is identified if  $ \\alpha  $ and  $ p  $ are both nonzero. \nIn such a case, the solution for  $ \\alpha  $ and  $ p  $ is found to be:\n$ \n\\alpha = -6, \\quad p = -1\n$ \n\nWith these values, the integration constant  $ C  $ is determined by substituting \na known point from the numerical solution into the ansatz.
