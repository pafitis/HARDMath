Simplifying the equation gives us two separate equations, one for the coefficients and another for the powers of  $  (x - x^*)  $ .\n\nThe coefficients' equation is:\n$ $ \n\\alpha p \\left(p - 2\\right) \\left(p - 1\\right) = \\alpha^{2} p^{2}\n$ $ \n\nThe powers' equation is:\n$ $ \np - 3 = 2 p - 2\n$ $ \n\nSolving this system of equations provides the values of  $  \\alpha  $  and  $  p  $ . \nA valid solution is identified if  $  \\alpha  $  and  $  p  $  are both nonzero. \nIn such a case, the solution for  $  \\alpha  $  and  $  p  $  is found to be:\n$ $ \n\\alpha = -6, \\quad p = -1\n$ $ \n\nWith these values, the integration constant  $  C  $  is determined by substituting \na known point from the numerical solution into the ansatz. This yields the following equation for  $  C  $ :\n$ $ \n61.2446961654432 = C + 66.6599999999993\n$ $ \n\nSolving this equation, we find the value of  $  C  $  to be:\n$ $ \nC = -5.4153038345561,\n$ $ \n\nso, the analytical approximation for the solution at large $ x$  (near the divergence point) is given by\n$ $ \ny = -6 (x - 9.39093909390939)^{-1} + (-5.4153038345561),\n$ $ \n\nand the analytical approximation for the solution at small $ x$  is given by\n$ $ \ny = 1 - \\frac{x^{3}}{12}.\n$ $ \n\nThus, the solution is given by \n$  $ boxed{[y = 1 - \\frac{x^{3}}{12}, y = -6 (x - 9.39093909390939)^{-1} + (-5.4153038345561)]}$ $ \n\n\n\nPlease grade the response based on the following criteria:\n\n You only need to take the analytical expression solutions for small and large x regimes in response and solution for comparison. This grade's final score should be between 0 to 1. You need to consider both the small and large x solutions. For each solution, if it  completely matches the elements in ground truth give full credit, give half credit if it gets partially correct and give no credit if it's completely wrong (a way tp determine is see whether the ground truth solution and the response have order of magnitude difference at given x regime). Give the final grading as a float in Latex boxed format \\[boxed{}\\].",
