In the large $x$ regime, the dominant balance is given by $y''' = \\left(\\frac{d}{dx} y\\right)^4$.\n\nUsing the dominant balance in the small $x$ regime, the solution can be derived by setting $x=0$, analytically solving the dominant balance equation for $y$, and plugging in the initial conditions. The solution in the small $x$ regime is $y(x) = 1 + \\frac{x^3}{6}$.\n\nIn the large $x$ regime, the solution uses an ansatz of the form $y = \\alpha (x - x^*)^p$, where $x^*$ is the divergence point. By plugging in the ansatz and solving for the terms, we find the solution in the large $x$ regime to be $y = \\sqrt[3]{30} (x - 11.4511451145115)^{\\frac{1}{3}} + 2.52870954143885$.\n\nTherefore, the analytical expressions that approximate the solution of $y(x)$ in the small $x$ and large $x$ regimes are given by the following Python lists:\n\nSmall $x$ regime: $[1, x**3/6]$\n\nLarge $x$ regime: $[\\sqrt[3]{30}*(x - 11.4511451145115)**(1/3) + 2.52870954143885]$ \n\nThus, the final answer is  $boxed{[1, x**3/6, \\sqrt[3]{30}*(x - 11.4511451145115)**(1/3) + 2.52870954143885]}$ .\n\n and this ground truth         solution: The dominant balance in the small x regime is given by  $frac{d^{3}}{d x^{3}} y = \\frac{y}{12 x + 11},$  and the dominant balance in the large x regime is given by  $frac{d^{3}}{d x^{3}} y = \\left(\\frac{d}{d x} y\\right)^{4}$ \nUsing the dominant balance in the small x regime, the solution can be derived by     setting $x=0$, analytically solving the dominant balance equation     for y, and plugging in the initial conditions. The solution is thus $ y{\\left(x \\right)} = \\frac{x^{3}}{66} + 1$  in the small x regime.\n\nThe solution for the large  $ x  $ regime uses an ansatz of the form \n$  y = \\alpha (x - x^*)^p, $  \nwhere  $ x^*  $ is the divergence point.
