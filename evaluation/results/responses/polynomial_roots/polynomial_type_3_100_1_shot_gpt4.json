We'll analyze the dominant balances to find the roots in each case, similar to the process outlined in the example.\n\n### For Large Positive $\\epsilon$\n\nIn this limit, we expect $A$ to dominate, so we consider the balance between $A$ and either $B$ or $C$. However, since $C$ is a constant and $B$ scales with $x$ to a lower power than $A$, $A$ and $B$ give the most meaningful balance for large $\\epsilon$. Thus, we ignore $C$ and solve $\\epsilon x^{10} - x^7 = 0$.\n\n\\[ \\epsilon x^{10} - x^7 = 0 \\]\n\\[ \\Rightarrow \\epsilon x^{10} = x^7 \\]\n\\[ \\Rightarrow \\epsilon = x^{-3} \\]\n\\[ \\Rightarrow x = \\left( \\frac{1}{\\epsilon} \\right)^{-\\frac{1}{3}} \\]\n\nThis approximation works when $\\epsilon$ is large because the $x^{10}$ term (scaled by a large $\\epsilon$) and the $x^7$ term are comparable in magnitude, making $C$ negligible. This gives us a single term approximation for large $\\epsilon$.\n\n### For Small Positive $\\epsilon$\n\nIn the limit of small $\\epsilon$, $A$ becomes negligible, so we focus on the balance between $B$ and $C$, effectively ignoring $A$. We solve $-x^7 + 1 = 0$.\n\n\\[ -x^7 + 1 = 0 \\]\n\\[ \\Rightarrow x^7 = 1 \\]\n\nThis gives us the roots in terms of the 7th root of unity:\n\n\\[ x = e^{\\frac{2\\pi i k}{7}}, \\quad k=0,1,...,6 \\]\n\nThese roots are valid in the limit of small $\\epsilon$ since the $-x^7$ term and $+1$ are comparable, and $\\epsilon x^{10}$ is negligible.\n\n### Python Lists for SymPy Conversion\n\nFor large positive $\\epsilon$, we have:\n\n\\[ \\text{Large } \\epsilon: \\left[ \\left( \\frac{1}{\\epsilon} \\right)^{-\\frac{1}{3}} \\right] \\]\n\nFor small positive $\\epsilon$, we have:\n\n\\[ \\text{Small } \\epsilon: \\left[ e^{\\frac{2\\pi i k}{7}} | k=0,1,...,6 \\right] \\]\n\nGiven the hint to provide these in a form convertible by SymPy, we represent these findings in a LaTeX box:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{align*}\n\\text{For large } \\epsilon: & \\left[ \\left( \\epsilon^{-1} \\right)^{-1/3} \\right] \\\\\n\\text{For small } \\epsilon: & \\left[ e^{2\\pi i/7}, \\ e^{4\\pi i/7}, \\ e^{6\\pi i/7}, \\ e^{8\\pi i/7}, \\ e^{10\\pi i/7}, \\ e^{12\\pi i/7}, \\ e^{14\\pi i/7} \\right]\n\\end{align*}\n}\n\\]",

This gives us the simplified equation\n\n\\[\\epsilon x^{4} \\approx 0.\\]\n\nHowever, this approximation does not yield meaningful roots directly as it suggests \\(x\\) might be infinitely small, which isn't a useful approximation here. For large \\(\\epsilon\\), a better approach is to not disregard the \\(x^3\\) term entirely but to note that no simple dominant balance gives a clear approximation without further context on the size of \\(x\\). A more nuanced approach considering the full polynomial might be needed, but for the sake of a single-term approximation, we will proceed under the assumption that the influence of \\(\\epsilon\\) makes the \\(x^3\\) term comparably significant.\n\n### For Small Positive \\(\\epsilon\\)\n\nWhen \\(\\epsilon\\) is small, the \\(\\epsilon x^{4}\\) term can be considered negligible compared to \\(x^{3} + 1\\).

For large \\(\\epsilon\\), a precise single-term approximation may not be meaningful without additional assumptions on the behavior of \\(x\\) or more sophisticated methods to handle the leading term's dominance.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe final lists of approximate expressions for the polynomial roots, first for large \\(\\epsilon\\) and then for small \\(\\epsilon\\), are provided below.
