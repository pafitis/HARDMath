This involves a careful analysis and the application of nondimensionalization principles that adjust each term's scale correctly.\n\nUnfortunately, my initial response skipped these critical steps and insights, leading to a misalignment with the correct methodology for nondimensionalization.

The typical method would involve identifying a scaling factor based on the dimensions and coefficients of the terms to render them dimensionless, but the solution requires a clear demonstration of how to apply this in the context of the polynomial given.\n\nGiven the oversight in the directly applicable method, let's correct the course and provide a clear solution based on correctly applying nondimensionalization principles to the polynomial at hand:\n\nThe correct approach for nondimensionalizing \\[P(x) = -6x^{2} + 10x - 1\\] with a focus on simplicity and aligning with the expected outcome would involve identifying a scale for $x$ that simplifies the coefficient in front of $y^2$ relative to the other terms, considering the direct nondimensionalization process leads to a more complex interplay of the coefficients and the desired simple form. Therefore, let's adjust to provide a focused solution on how to achieve $\\epsilon y^{2} \\pm y \\pm 1$ from the given polynomial without misapplying the formula:\n\nGiven the polynomial does not straightforwardly fit the initial nondimensionalization scheme provided due to its structure and our goal, we recognize the need for a specific solution tailored to this question.
