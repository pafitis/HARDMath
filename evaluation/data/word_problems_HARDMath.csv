"At the Quantum Dynamics Research Institute, Dr. Patel is investigating the behaviour of a quantum system using mathematical models. One such model involves the polynomial \[P(x) =\epsilon x^{4} - x^{2} + 1.\] This polynomial describes the energy levels of particles within the system under certain conditions.

As Dr. Patel's research assistant, your task is to analyse how changes in 
$\epsilon$ affect the stability of the system. The roots of the polynomial correspond to the energy levels of the particles. By examining how these roots behave as $\epsilon$ approaches zero and as it becomes very large, you could gain insights into the stability of the quantum system.

"Suppose you are planning to become a beekeeper, and your mentor tells you that there is a `golden rule' to beekeeping: the revenue earned depends on the number of bees in a hive in a particular season, and is determined by a polynomial equation. The break-even populations of a hive are therefore the roots of the nondimensionalized polynomial, i.e., the points where $$\epsilon x^{5} + x^{2} + 1 = 0.$$

This equation arises as the balance between the revenue generated from the honey and other products created by the bees, represented by $x^2$ and the cost of maintaining the bees. This cost includes two components: the term given by $\epsilon x^5$ accounts for the nonlinear increase in expenses related hive maintenance as the bee population grows, while $1$ is the scaled fixed cost of operating the beekeeping business.

Use the method of dominant balance to calculate the bee populations in your hive at which you will break even. Do this by finding approximate expressions for all roots of the polynomial in the limit of small positive $\epsilon$ and large positive $\epsilon$.

Find first-order approximations for all roots of the polynomial in the limit of small and large positive $\epsilon$.","We begin by equating the population growth equation to zero to solve for the roots: $P(x) = 0.$ This problem can be rewritten in the form $A+B+C=0$, where: $A=\epsilon x^{3};$ $B=- x^{2};$ $C=-1.$

We find approximate solutions to the roots by considering the three possible dominant balances. For each dominant balance, we find the roots of the resulting equation and evaluate whether each balance is self-consistent for small or large positive $\epsilon$. \vspace{1em}

We start with the balance $A+B=0$, assuming that $|C|$ is negligible when compared to $|A|$ and $|B|$. Solving this for $x$ in terms of $\epsilon$ then gives us 1 non-zero root: 
\[\epsilon x^{3} - x^{2}=0 \]\[ \implies \boxed{ x=\left[ \frac{1}{\epsilon}\right]}.\]
To verify that these roots are consistent with the assumption that $|A|, |B| \gg |C|,$ we substitute these found roots back into the terms $A$, $B$, and $C$ and compare their magnitudes. Using this method, we find that it is true that these roots are valid for small $\epsilon$, while validity for large $\epsilon$ is false.

\underline{Therefore, these roots are valid in the limit of small positive $\epsilon$ only.}\vspace{1em}

Next we examine the balance $B+C=0$, assuming that $|A|$ is negligible when compared to $|B|$ and $|C|$. Solving this for $x$ in terms of $\epsilon$ gives us 2 non-zero roots: \[- x^{2} - 1=0\]\[ \implies\boxed{ x=\left[ - i, \  i\right]}.\]

Solving this for $x$ in terms of $\epsilon$ gives us 3 non-zero roots: \[\epsilon x^{3} - 1=0\]\[ \implies\boxed{ x=\left[ \frac{\left(-1 - \sqrt{3} i\right) \sqrt[3]{\frac{1}{\epsilon}}}{2}, \  \frac{\left(-1 + \sqrt{3} i\right) \sqrt[3]{\frac{1}{\epsilon}}}{2}, \  \sqrt[3]{\frac{1}{\epsilon}}\right]}.\]

By the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra, a polynomial of degree 3 has exactly 3 roots. We have found 3 roots for the population growth equation that are valid in the limit of small positive $\epsilon$ and 3 roots valid in the limit of large positive $\epsilon$. Our method therefore provides a complete solution to the problem, finding the correct number of roots in each $\epsilon$ regime. 

The roots of the population growth equation for large positive $\epsilon$ are\[ \boxed{ \left[ \frac{\left(-1 - \sqrt{3} i\right) \sqrt[3]{\frac{1}{\epsilon}}}{2}, \  \frac{\left(-1 + \sqrt{3} i\right) \sqrt[3]{\frac{1}{\epsilon}}}{2}, \  \sqrt[3]{\frac{1}{\epsilon}}\right]} \]and the roots of $P(x)$ for small positive $\epsilon$ are\[ \boxed{ \left[ \frac{1}{\epsilon}, \  - i, \  i\right]} \]",polynomial_roots,list,,,,,,,

"Imagine you are part of a research team studying atmospheric dynamics at various altitudes using sophisticated weather balloons. These balloons are influenced by multiple atmospheric layers, each with different properties. The following equation provided models the vertical displacement of a weather balloon as it travels through these layers: $$y''' = \frac{y}{x^{3} - 9} + y'^{5} - \frac{y''}{2 x^{3} + 3} - 5 e^{- x},$$ where $y(x)$ represents the altitude of the balloon in meters and $x$ represents the time in hours. The differential equation has the following initial conditions at $x = 0: y(0) = 2.00, y'(0) = 0.00, y''(0) = 3.00.$
Find an approximate analytical formula for the height of the balloon after a large amount of time has passed (in the large $x$ regime).

","One can solve for the altitude of the balloon using the method of dominant balance. The dominant balance in the large x regime is given by $$\frac{d^{3}}{d x^{3}} y = \left(\frac{d}{d x} y\right)^{5}.$$

The solution for the large \( x \) regime uses an ansatz of the form 
$$ y = \alpha (x - x^*)^p, $$ 
where \( x^* \) is the divergence point. Plugging in the ansatz and solving for the terms yields 
$$
\alpha p \left(p - 2\right) \left(p - 1\right) \left(x - 2.9404\right)^{p - 3} = \alpha^{5} p^{5} \left(x - 2.9404\right)^{5 p - 5}
$$

After substituting the derivatives, the equation is reorganized to collect terms with respect to \( (x - x^*) \). This leads to an equation where the coefficients and powers of \( (x - x^*) \) are equated on both sides. Simplifying the equation gives us two separate equations, one for the coefficients and another for the powers of \( (x - x^*) \).

The coefficients' equation is:
$$

Solving this system of equations provides the values of \( \alpha \) and \( p \). 
A valid solution is identified if \( \alpha \) and \( p \) are both nonzero.

Solving this equation, we find the value of \( C \) to be:

"Tourist attractions can produce significant revenue that help cities thrive. However, the popularity of many attractions can depend on several factors, such as the proximity to restaurants or historical significance. Suppose $x$ is the age of a particular tourist attraction in years, and $\epsilon$ is its cost of construction. If the revenue produced by the attraction is given by $I(\epsilon) = \int_0^{38.00} \frac{1}{\epsilon + 6.0 x^{5.0} + 2.0 x^{10.0}} dx$, develop distinct analytical formulas that approximate its value $I(\epsilon)$ for different costs of construction $\epsilon$.","
    The integral is of the form $I(\epsilon) = \int_0^{38} \frac{1}{\epsilon + P(x)} dx$ where $P(x)$ is a polynomial. Thus, its value can be estimated as the product between a height and a width.
    Since the integrand is maximized at $x = 0$, the height can be set to $\frac{1}{\epsilon}$.

    For small $\epsilon$,
    we define the width as the point where the integrand becomes half of its maximum height.
    This corresponds to solving for $x$ given $P(x) = \epsilon$.
    Applying dominant balance, considering the term in $P(x)$ with the smallest degree, the width is approximated as $ \left( \frac{1}{6.0*\epsilon} \right)^{1/5.0} $.
    Therefore, the analytical approximation of the integral for small $\epsilon$ is $\boxed{I(\epsilon) = \frac{0.6988}{\epsilon^{0.8}}}$.

    we also define the width based on the term with the largest degree.
    The width is approximated as \( \left( \frac{1}{2.0*\epsilon} \right)^{1/10.0} \).
    Therefore, the analytical approximation of the integral for large $\epsilon$ is $\boxed{I(\epsilon) = \frac{0.8706}{\epsilon^{0.8}}}$.

"Many climate scientists study the global carbon dioxide (CO2) absorption by the oceans. The rate of CO2 absorption at different latitudes depends on $x$, the depth of the ocean at that latitude, and $\epsilon$, which accounts for the influence of various physical and biological factors on CO2 absorption, such as ocean temperature, salinity, and phytoplankton productivity. To estimate the total annual CO2 absorption by the oceans, you need to calculate $I(\epsilon) = \int_0^{14.00} \frac{1}{\epsilon + 4.0 x^{7.0} + 3.0 x^{10.0} + 7.0 x^{13.0} + 13.0 x^{17.0}} dx$.
