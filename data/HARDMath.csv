"Consider the polynomial\[P(x) =\epsilon x^{9} + x^{4} - 1.\] 
Find approximate expressions for all roots of the polynomials in the limit of small positive $\epsilon$ and large positive $\epsilon$. Only a single term approximation to the root is required. ","Consider the problem to be of form $A+B+C=0$, with $A$, $B$, and $C$ corresponding to the three terms in $P(x)$ :$A=\epsilon x^{9};$ $B=x^{4};$ $C=-1.$
We now consider the three possible dominant balances, solving for the roots in each case and evaluating whether each balance holds for large or for small $\epsilon$.\vspace{1em}

We start with the balance $A+B=0$, assuming that $|C|$ is negligible when compared to $|A|$ and $|B|$. Solving this for $x$ in terms of $\epsilon$ then gives us 5 non-zero roots: 
\[\epsilon x^{9} + x^{4}=0 \]\[ \implies \boxed{ x=\left[ \sqrt[5]{- \frac{1}{\epsilon}}, \  \frac{\sqrt[5]{- \frac{1}{\epsilon}} \left(-1 + \sqrt{5} - \sqrt{2} \sqrt{-5 - \sqrt{5}}\right)}{4}, \  \frac{\sqrt[5]{- \frac{1}{\epsilon}} \left(-1 + \sqrt{5} + \sqrt{2} \sqrt{-5 - \sqrt{5}}\right)}{4}, \  \frac{\sqrt[5]{- \frac{1}{\epsilon}} \left(- \sqrt{5} - 1 - \sqrt{2} \sqrt{-5 + \sqrt{5}}\right)}{4}, \  \frac{\sqrt[5]{- \frac{1}{\epsilon}} \left(- \sqrt{5} - 1 + \sqrt{2} \sqrt{-5 + \sqrt{5}}\right)}{4}\right]}.\]
To verify the roots found for consistency with our initial assumption, we check that $|A|,|B|>>|C|$ holds for this root by substituting our found root expression for $x$ back into $A$, $B$, and $C$ and comparing their magnitudes. Using this method, we find that validity for small $\epsilon$ is True and validity for large $\epsilon$ is False.

\underline{Therefore, these roots are valid in the limit of small positive $\epsilon$ only.}\vspace{1em}

Next we examine the balance $B+C=0$, assuming that $|A|$ is negligible when compared to $|B|$ and $|C|$. Solving this for $x$ in terms of $\epsilon$ gives us 4 non-zero roots: \[x^{4} - 1=0\]\[ \implies\boxed{ x=\left[ -1, \  1, \  - i, \  i\right]}.\]

\underline{Therefore, these roots are valid in the limit of small positive $\epsilon$ only.}\vspace{1em}

Finally, we examine the balance $A+C=0$, assuming that $|B|$ is negligible when compared to $|A|$ and $|C|$. Solving this for $x$ in terms of $\epsilon$ gives us 9 non-zero roots: \[\epsilon x^{9} - 1=0\]\[ \implies\boxed{ x=\left[ - \sqrt[9]{\frac{1}{\epsilon}} e^{\frac{i \pi}{9}}, \  - \sqrt[9]{\frac{1}{\epsilon}} e^{- \frac{i \pi}{9}}, \  \sqrt[9]{\frac{1}{\epsilon}} e^{- \frac{2 i \pi}{9}}, \  \sqrt[9]{\frac{1}{\epsilon}} e^{\frac{2 i \pi}{9}}, \  \left(\sin{\left(\frac{\pi}{18} \right)} - i \cos{\left(\frac{\pi}{18} \right)}\right) \sqrt[9]{\frac{1}{\epsilon}}, \  \left(\sin{\left(\frac{\pi}{18} \right)} + i \cos{\left(\frac{\pi}{18} \right)}\right) \sqrt[9]{\frac{1}{\epsilon}}, \  \frac{\left(-1 - \sqrt{3} i\right) \sqrt[9]{\frac{1}{\epsilon}}}{2}, \  \frac{\left(-1 + \sqrt{3} i\right) \sqrt[9]{\frac{1}{\epsilon}}}{2}, \  \sqrt[9]{\frac{1}{\epsilon}}\right]}.\]
To verify the roots found for consistency with our initial assumption, we check that $|A|,|C|>>|B|$ holds for this root by substituting our found root expression for $x$ back into $A$, $B$, and $C$ and comparing their magnitudes. Using this method, we find that validity for small $\epsilon$ is False and validity for large $\epsilon$ is True.

\underline{Therefore, these roots are valid in the limit of large positive $\epsilon$ only.}\vspace{1em}

We expect that, in each $\epsilon$ regime, we have the same number of roots as the degree of the polynomial $P(x)$. We have found a total of 18 roots, half of which are valid in the limit of small positive $\epsilon$ and the other half of which are valid in the limit of large positive $\epsilon$. This is expected given the degree of the polynomial.

"Consider the polynomial\[P(x) =\epsilon x^{10} + x^{9} - 1.\] 
Find approximate expressions for all roots of the polynomials in the limit of small positive $\epsilon$ and large positive $\epsilon$. Only a single term approximation to the root is required. ","Consider the problem to be of form $A+B+C=0$, with $A$, $B$, and $C$ corresponding to the three terms in $P(x)$ :$A=\epsilon x^{10};$ $B=x^{9};$ $C=-1.$
We now consider the three possible dominant balances, solving for the roots in each case and evaluating whether each balance holds for large or for small $\epsilon$.\vspace{1em}

We start with the balance $A+B=0$, assuming that $|C|$ is negligible when compared to $|A|$ and $|B|$. Solving this for $x$ in terms of $\epsilon$ then gives us 1 non-zero root: 
\[\epsilon x^{10} + x^{9}=0 \]\[ \implies \boxed{ x=\left[ - \frac{1}{\epsilon}\right]}.\]
To verify the roots found for consistency with our initial assumption, we check that $|A|,|B|>>|C|$ holds for this root by substituting our found root expression for $x$ back into $A$, $B$, and $C$ and comparing their magnitudes. Using this method, we find that validity for small $\epsilon$ is True and validity for large $\epsilon$ is False.

\underline{Therefore, these roots are valid in the limit of small positive $\epsilon$ only.}\vspace{1em}

Next we examine the balance $B+C=0$, assuming that $|A|$ is negligible when compared to $|B|$ and $|C|$. Solving this for $x$ in terms of $\epsilon$ gives us 9 non-zero roots: \[x^{9} - 1=0\]\[ \implies\boxed{ x=\left[ 1, \  - \frac{1}{2} - \frac{\sqrt{3} i}{2}, \  - \frac{1}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{3} i}{2}, \  - e^{\frac{i \pi}{9}}, \  - e^{- \frac{i \pi}{9}}, \  e^{- \frac{2 i \pi}{9}}, \  e^{\frac{2 i \pi}{9}}, \  \sin{\left(\frac{\pi}{18} \right)} - i \cos{\left(\frac{\pi}{18} \right)}, \  \sin{\left(\frac{\pi}{18} \right)} + i \cos{\left(\frac{\pi}{18} \right)}\right]}.\]

Solving this for $x$ in terms of $\epsilon$ gives us 10 non-zero roots: \[\epsilon x^{10} - 1=0\]\[ \implies\boxed{ x=\left[ \frac{\left(- \sqrt{5} - 1 - \sqrt{2} \sqrt{-5 + \sqrt{5}}\right) \sqrt[10]{\frac{1}{\epsilon}}}{4}, \  \frac{\left(- \sqrt{5} - 1 + \sqrt{2} \sqrt{-5 + \sqrt{5}}\right) \sqrt[10]{\frac{1}{\epsilon}}}{4}, \  \frac{\left(- \sqrt{5} + 1 - \sqrt{2} \sqrt{-5 - \sqrt{5}}\right) \sqrt[10]{\frac{1}{\epsilon}}}{4}, \  \frac{\left(- \sqrt{5} + 1 + \sqrt{2} \sqrt{-5 - \sqrt{5}}\right) \sqrt[10]{\frac{1}{\epsilon}}}{4}, \  \frac{\left(-1 + \sqrt{5} - \sqrt{2} \sqrt{-5 - \sqrt{5}}\right) \sqrt[10]{\frac{1}{\epsilon}}}{4}, \  \frac{\left(-1 + \sqrt{5} + \sqrt{2} \sqrt{-5 - \sqrt{5}}\right) \sqrt[10]{\frac{1}{\epsilon}}}{4}, \  \frac{\left(1 + \sqrt{5} - \sqrt{2} \sqrt{-5 + \sqrt{5}}\right) \sqrt[10]{\frac{1}{\epsilon}}}{4}, \  \frac{\left(1 + \sqrt{5} + \sqrt{2} \sqrt{-5 + \sqrt{5}}\right) \sqrt[10]{\frac{1}{\epsilon}}}{4}, \  - \sqrt[10]{\frac{1}{\epsilon}}, \  \sqrt[10]{\frac{1}{\epsilon}}\right]}.\]

We expect that, in each $\epsilon$ regime, we have the same number of roots as the degree of the polynomial $P(x)$.

"Consider the polynomial\[P(x) =\epsilon x^{9} + x^{7} - 1.\] 
Find approximate expressions for all roots of the polynomials in the limit of small positive $\epsilon$ and large positive $\epsilon$. Only a single term approximation to the root is required. ","Consider the problem to be of form $A+B+C=0$, with $A$, $B$, and $C$ corresponding to the three terms in $P(x)$ :$A=\epsilon x^{9};$ $B=x^{7};$ $C=-1.$
We now consider the three possible dominant balances, solving for the roots in each case and evaluating whether each balance holds for large or for small $\epsilon$.\vspace{1em}

We start with the balance $A+B=0$, assuming that $|C|$ is negligible when compared to $|A|$ and $|B|$. Solving this for $x$ in terms of $\epsilon$ then gives us 2 non-zero roots: 
\[\epsilon x^{9} + x^{7}=0 \]\[ \implies \boxed{ x=\left[ - \sqrt{- \frac{1}{\epsilon}}, \  \sqrt{- \frac{1}{\epsilon}}\right]}.\]
To verify the roots found for consistency with our initial assumption, we check that $|A|,|B|>>|C|$ holds for this root by substituting our found root expression for $x$ back into $A$, $B$, and $C$ and comparing their magnitudes. Using this method, we find that validity for small $\epsilon$ is True and validity for large $\epsilon$ is False.

"Consider the polynomial\[P(x) =\epsilon x^{8} - x^{5} + 1.\] 
Find approximate expressions for all roots of the polynomials in the limit of small positive $\epsilon$ and large positive $\epsilon$. Only a single term approximation to the root is required. ","Consider the problem to be of form $A+B+C=0$, with $A$, $B$, and $C$ corresponding to the three terms in $P(x)$ :$A=\epsilon x^{8};$ $B=- x^{5};$ $C=1.$
We now consider the three possible dominant balances, solving for the roots in each case and evaluating whether each balance holds for large or for small $\epsilon$.\vspace{1em}

We start with the balance $A+B=0$, assuming that $|C|$ is negligible when compared to $|A|$ and $|B|$. Solving this for $x$ in terms of $\epsilon$ then gives us 3 non-zero roots: 
\[\epsilon x^{8} - x^{5}=0 \]\[ \implies \boxed{ x=\left[ \frac{\left(-1 - \sqrt{3} i\right) \sqrt[3]{\frac{1}{\epsilon}}}{2}, \  \frac{\left(-1 + \sqrt{3} i\right) \sqrt[3]{\frac{1}{\epsilon}}}{2}, \  \sqrt[3]{\frac{1}{\epsilon}}\right]}.\]
To verify the roots found for consistency with our initial assumption, we check that $|A|,|B|>>|C|$ holds for this root by substituting our found root expression for $x$ back into $A$, $B$, and $C$ and comparing their magnitudes. Using this method, we find that validity for small $\epsilon$ is True and validity for large $\epsilon$ is False.

\underline{Therefore, these roots are valid in the limit of small positive $\epsilon$ only.}\vspace{1em}

Next we examine the balance $B+C=0$, assuming that $|A|$ is negligible when compared to $|B|$ and $|C|$. Solving this for $x$ in terms of $\epsilon$ gives us 5 non-zero roots: \[1 - x^{5}=0\]\[ \implies\boxed{ x=\left[ 1, \  - \frac{1}{4} + \frac{\sqrt{5}}{4} - \frac{i \sqrt{2 \sqrt{5} + 10}}{4}, \  - \frac{1}{4} + \frac{\sqrt{5}}{4} + \frac{\sqrt{-10 - 2 \sqrt{5}}}{4}, \  - \frac{\sqrt{5}}{4} - \frac{1}{4} - \frac{i \sqrt{10 - 2 \sqrt{5}}}{4}, \  - \frac{\sqrt{5}}{4} - \frac{1}{4} + \frac{i \sqrt{10 - 2 \sqrt{5}}}{4}\right]}.\]

\underline{Therefore, these roots are valid in the limit of small positive $\epsilon$ only.}\vspace{1em}

Finally, we examine the balance $A+C=0$, assuming that $|B|$ is negligible when compared to $|A|$ and $|C|$. Solving this for $x$ in terms of $\epsilon$ gives us 8 non-zero roots: \[\epsilon x^{8} + 1=0\]\[ \implies\boxed{ x=\left[ - \sqrt[8]{- \frac{1}{\epsilon}}, \  \sqrt[8]{- \frac{1}{\epsilon}}, \  - i \sqrt[8]{- \frac{1}{\epsilon}}, \  i \sqrt[8]{- \frac{1}{\epsilon}}, \  \frac{\sqrt{2} \sqrt[8]{- \frac{1}{\epsilon}} \left(-1 - i\right)}{2}, \  \frac{\sqrt{2} \sqrt[8]{- \frac{1}{\epsilon}} \left(-1 + i\right)}{2}, \  \frac{\sqrt{2} \sqrt[8]{- \frac{1}{\epsilon}} \left(1 - i\right)}{2}, \  \frac{\sqrt{2} \sqrt[8]{- \frac{1}{\epsilon}} \left(1 + i\right)}{2}\right]}.\]

\underline{Therefore, these roots are valid in the limit of large positive $\epsilon$ only.}\vspace{1em}

We expect that, in each $\epsilon$ regime, we have the same number of roots as the degree of the polynomial $P(x)$. We have found a total of 16 roots, half of which are valid in the limit of small positive $\epsilon$ and the other half of which are valid in the limit of large positive $\epsilon$.

"Consider the polynomial\[P(x) =\epsilon x^{10} + x^{3} - 1.\] 
Find approximate expressions for all roots of the polynomials in the limit of small positive $\epsilon$ and large positive $\epsilon$. Only a single term approximation to the root is required. ","Consider the problem to be of form $A+B+C=0$, with $A$, $B$, and $C$ corresponding to the three terms in $P(x)$ :$A=\epsilon x^{10};$ $B=x^{3};$ $C=-1.$
We now consider the three possible dominant balances, solving for the roots in each case and evaluating whether each balance holds for large or for small $\epsilon$.\vspace{1em}

We start with the balance $A+B=0$, assuming that $|C|$ is negligible when compared to $|A|$ and $|B|$. Solving this for $x$ in terms of $\epsilon$ then gives us 7 non-zero roots: 
\[\epsilon x^{10} + x^{3}=0 \]\[ \implies \boxed{ x=\left[ \sqrt[7]{- \frac{1}{\epsilon}}, \  - \sqrt[7]{- \frac{1}{\epsilon}} e^{\frac{i \pi}{7}}, \  - \sqrt[7]{- \frac{1}{\epsilon}} e^{- \frac{i \pi}{7}}, \  \sqrt[7]{- \frac{1}{\epsilon}} e^{- \frac{2 i \pi}{7}}, \  \sqrt[7]{- \frac{1}{\epsilon}} e^{\frac{2 i \pi}{7}}, \  - \sqrt[7]{- \frac{1}{\epsilon}} \left(\sin{\left(\frac{\pi}{14} \right)} + i \cos{\left(\frac{\pi}{14} \right)}\right), \  \sqrt[7]{- \frac{1}{\epsilon}} \left(- \sin{\left(\frac{\pi}{14} \right)} + i \cos{\left(\frac{\pi}{14} \right)}\right)\right]}.\]
To verify the roots found for consistency with our initial assumption, we check that $|A|,|B|>>|C|$ holds for this root by substituting our found root expression for $x$ back into $A$, $B$, and $C$ and comparing their magnitudes. Using this method, we find that validity for small $\epsilon$ is True and validity for large $\epsilon$ is False.

\underline{Therefore, these roots are valid in the limit of small positive $\epsilon$ only.}\vspace{1em}

Next we examine the balance $B+C=0$, assuming that $|A|$ is negligible when compared to $|B|$ and $|C|$. Solving this for $x$ in terms of $\epsilon$ gives us 3 non-zero roots: \[x^{3} - 1=0\]\[ \implies\boxed{ x=\left[ 1, \  - \frac{1}{2} - \frac{\sqrt{3} i}{2}, \  - \frac{1}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{3} i}{2}\right]}.\]

\underline{Therefore, these roots are valid in the limit of small positive $\epsilon$ only.}\vspace{1em}

Finally, we examine the balance $A+C=0$, assuming that $|B|$ is negligible when compared to $|A|$ and $|C|$. Solving this for $x$ in terms of $\epsilon$ gives us 10 non-zero roots: \[\epsilon x^{10} - 1=0\]\[ \implies\boxed{ x=\left[ \frac{\left(- \sqrt{5} - 1 - \sqrt{2} \sqrt{-5 + \sqrt{5}}\right) \sqrt[10]{\frac{1}{\epsilon}}}{4}, \  \frac{\left(- \sqrt{5} - 1 + \sqrt{2} \sqrt{-5 + \sqrt{5}}\right) \sqrt[10]{\frac{1}{\epsilon}}}{4}, \  \frac{\left(- \sqrt{5} + 1 - \sqrt{2} \sqrt{-5 - \sqrt{5}}\right) \sqrt[10]{\frac{1}{\epsilon}}}{4}, \  \frac{\left(- \sqrt{5} + 1 + \sqrt{2} \sqrt{-5 - \sqrt{5}}\right) \sqrt[10]{\frac{1}{\epsilon}}}{4}, \  \frac{\left(-1 + \sqrt{5} - \sqrt{2} \sqrt{-5 - \sqrt{5}}\right) \sqrt[10]{\frac{1}{\epsilon}}}{4}, \  \frac{\left(-1 + \sqrt{5} + \sqrt{2} \sqrt{-5 - \sqrt{5}}\right) \sqrt[10]{\frac{1}{\epsilon}}}{4}, \  \frac{\left(1 + \sqrt{5} - \sqrt{2} \sqrt{-5 + \sqrt{5}}\right) \sqrt[10]{\frac{1}{\epsilon}}}{4}, \  \frac{\left(1 + \sqrt{5} + \sqrt{2} \sqrt{-5 + \sqrt{5}}\right) \sqrt[10]{\frac{1}{\epsilon}}}{4}, \  - \sqrt[10]{\frac{1}{\epsilon}}, \  \sqrt[10]{\frac{1}{\epsilon}}\right]}.\]

We expect that, in each $\epsilon$ regime, we have the same number of roots as the degree of the polynomial $P(x)$. We have found a total of 20 roots, half of which are valid in the limit of small positive $\epsilon$ and the other half of which are valid in the limit of large positive $\epsilon$.

We now consider the three possible dominant balances, solving for the roots in each case and evaluating whether each balance holds for large or for small $\epsilon$.\vspace{1em}

We start with the balance $A+B=0$, assuming that $|C|$ is negligible when compared to $|A|$ and $|B|$. Solving this for $x$ in terms of $\epsilon$ then gives us 1 non-zero root: 
\[\epsilon x^{3} - x^{2}=0 \]\[ \implies \boxed{ x=\left[ \frac{1}{\epsilon}\right]}.\]
To verify the roots found for consistency with our initial assumption, we check that $|A|,|B|>>|C|$ holds for this root by substituting our found root expression for $x$ back into $A$, $B$, and $C$ and comparing their magnitudes. Using this method, we find that validity for small $\epsilon$ is True and validity for large $\epsilon$ is False.

\underline{Therefore, these roots are valid in the limit of small positive $\epsilon$ only.}\vspace{1em}

Next we examine the balance $B+C=0$, assuming that $|A|$ is negligible when compared to $|B|$ and $|C|$. Solving this for $x$ in terms of $\epsilon$ gives us 2 non-zero roots: \[- x^{2} - 1=0\]\[ \implies\boxed{ x=\left[ - i, \  i\right]}.\]

Solving this for $x$ in terms of $\epsilon$ gives us 3 non-zero roots: \[x^{3} + 1=0\]\[ \implies\boxed{ x=\left[ -1, \  \frac{1}{2} - \frac{\sqrt{3} i}{2}, \  \frac{1}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{3} i}{2}\right]}.\]

Using this method, we find that validity for small $\epsilon$ is True and validity for large $\epsilon$ is False.

We now consider the three possible dominant balances, solving for the roots in each case and evaluating whether each balance holds for large or for small $\epsilon$.\vspace{1em}

We start with the balance $A+B=0$, assuming that $|C|$ is negligible when compared to $|A|$ and $|B|$. Solving this for $x$ in terms of $\epsilon$ then gives us 6 non-zero roots: 
\[\epsilon x^{10} - x^{4}=0 \]\[ \implies \boxed{ x=\left[ \frac{\left(-1 - \sqrt{3} i\right) \sqrt[6]{\frac{1}{\epsilon}}}{2}, \  \frac{\left(-1 + \sqrt{3} i\right) \sqrt[6]{\frac{1}{\epsilon}}}{2}, \  \frac{\left(1 - \sqrt{3} i\right) \sqrt[6]{\frac{1}{\epsilon}}}{2}, \  \frac{\left(1 + \sqrt{3} i\right) \sqrt[6]{\frac{1}{\epsilon}}}{2}, \  - \sqrt[6]{\frac{1}{\epsilon}}, \  \sqrt[6]{\frac{1}{\epsilon}}\right]}.\]
To verify the roots found for consistency with our initial assumption, we check that $|A|,|B|>>|C|$ holds for this root by substituting our found root expression for $x$ back into $A$, $B$, and $C$ and comparing their magnitudes. Using this method, we find that validity for small $\epsilon$ is True and validity for large $\epsilon$ is False.

\underline{Therefore, these roots are valid in the limit of small positive $\epsilon$ only.}\vspace{1em}

Next we examine the balance $B+C=0$, assuming that $|A|$ is negligible when compared to $|B|$ and $|C|$. Solving this for $x$ in terms of $\epsilon$ gives us 4 non-zero roots: \[- x^{4} - 1=0\]\[ \implies\boxed{ x=\left[ \frac{\sqrt{2} \left(-1 - i\right)}{2}, \  \frac{\sqrt{2} \left(-1 + i\right)}{2}, \  \frac{\sqrt{2} \cdot \left(1 - i\right)}{2}, \  \frac{\sqrt{2} \cdot \left(1 + i\right)}{2}\right]}.\]
To verify the roots found for consistency with our initial assumption, we check that $|B|,|C|>>|A|$ holds for this root by substituting our found root expression for $x$ back into $A$, $B$, and $C$ and comparing their magnitudes. Using this method, we find that validity for small $\epsilon$ is True and validity for large $\epsilon$ is False.

\underline{Therefore, these roots are valid in the limit of small positive $\epsilon$ only.}\vspace{1em}

Finally, we examine the balance $A+C=0$, assuming that $|B|$ is negligible when compared to $|A|$ and $|C|$. Solving this for $x$ in terms of $\epsilon$ gives us 10 non-zero roots: \[\epsilon x^{10} - 1=0\]\[ \implies\boxed{ x=\left[ \frac{\left(- \sqrt{5} - 1 - \sqrt{2} \sqrt{-5 + \sqrt{5}}\right) \sqrt[10]{\frac{1}{\epsilon}}}{4}, \  \frac{\left(- \sqrt{5} - 1 + \sqrt{2} \sqrt{-5 + \sqrt{5}}\right) \sqrt[10]{\frac{1}{\epsilon}}}{4}, \  \frac{\left(- \sqrt{5} + 1 - \sqrt{2} \sqrt{-5 - \sqrt{5}}\right) \sqrt[10]{\frac{1}{\epsilon}}}{4}, \  \frac{\left(- \sqrt{5} + 1 + \sqrt{2} \sqrt{-5 - \sqrt{5}}\right) \sqrt[10]{\frac{1}{\epsilon}}}{4}, \  \frac{\left(-1 + \sqrt{5} - \sqrt{2} \sqrt{-5 - \sqrt{5}}\right) \sqrt[10]{\frac{1}{\epsilon}}}{4}, \  \frac{\left(-1 + \sqrt{5} + \sqrt{2} \sqrt{-5 - \sqrt{5}}\right) \sqrt[10]{\frac{1}{\epsilon}}}{4}, \  \frac{\left(1 + \sqrt{5} - \sqrt{2} \sqrt{-5 + \sqrt{5}}\right) \sqrt[10]{\frac{1}{\epsilon}}}{4}, \  \frac{\left(1 + \sqrt{5} + \sqrt{2} \sqrt{-5 + \sqrt{5}}\right) \sqrt[10]{\frac{1}{\epsilon}}}{4}, \  - \sqrt[10]{\frac{1}{\epsilon}}, \  \sqrt[10]{\frac{1}{\epsilon}}\right]}.\]
To verify the roots found for consistency with our initial assumption, we check that $|A|,|C|>>|B|$ holds for this root by substituting our found root expression for $x$ back into $A$, $B$, and $C$ and comparing their magnitudes. Using this method, we find that validity for small $\epsilon$ is False and validity for large $\epsilon$ is True.

\underline{Therefore, these roots are valid in the limit of large positive $\epsilon$ only.}\vspace{1em}

We expect that, in each $\epsilon$ regime, we have the same number of roots as the degree of the polynomial $P(x)$. We have found a total of 20 roots, half of which are valid in the limit of small positive $\epsilon$ and the other half of which are valid in the limit of large positive $\epsilon$. This is expected given the degree of the polynomial. So, the roots of $P(x)$ for large positive $\epsilon$ are\[ \boxed{ \left[ \frac{\left(- \sqrt{5} - 1 - \sqrt{2} \sqrt{-5 + \sqrt{5}}\right) \sqrt[10]{\frac{1}{\epsilon}}}{4}, \  \frac{\left(- \sqrt{5} - 1 + \sqrt{2} \sqrt{-5 + \sqrt{5}}\right) \sqrt[10]{\frac{1}{\epsilon}}}{4}, \  \frac{\left(- \sqrt{5} + 1 - \sqrt{2} \sqrt{-5 - \sqrt{5}}\right) \sqrt[10]{\frac{1}{\epsilon}}}{4}, \  \frac{\left(- \sqrt{5} + 1 + \sqrt{2} \sqrt{-5 - \sqrt{5}}\right) \sqrt[10]{\frac{1}{\epsilon}}}{4}, \  \frac{\left(-1 + \sqrt{5} - \sqrt{2} \sqrt{-5 - \sqrt{5}}\right) \sqrt[10]{\frac{1}{\epsilon}}}{4}, \  \frac{\left(-1 + \sqrt{5} + \sqrt{2} \sqrt{-5 - \sqrt{5}}\right) \sqrt[10]{\frac{1}{\epsilon}}}{4}, \  \frac{\left(1 + \sqrt{5} - \sqrt{2} \sqrt{-5 + \sqrt{5}}\right) \sqrt[10]{\frac{1}{\epsilon}}}{4}, \  \frac{\left(1 + \sqrt{5} + \sqrt{2} \sqrt{-5 + \sqrt{5}}\right) \sqrt[10]{\frac{1}{\epsilon}}}{4}, \  - \sqrt[10]{\frac{1}{\epsilon}}, \  \sqrt[10]{\frac{1}{\epsilon}}\right]} \]and the roots of $P(x)$ for small positive $\epsilon$ are\[ \boxed{ \left[ \frac{\left(-1 - \sqrt{3} i\right) \sqrt[6]{\frac{1}{\epsilon}}}{2}, \  \frac{\left(-1 + \sqrt{3} i\right) \sqrt[6]{\frac{1}{\epsilon}}}{2}, \  \frac{\left(1 - \sqrt{3} i\right) \sqrt[6]{\frac{1}{\epsilon}}}{2}, \  \frac{\left(1 + \sqrt{3} i\right) \sqrt[6]{\frac{1}{\epsilon}}}{2}, \  - \sqrt[6]{\frac{1}{\epsilon}}, \  \sqrt[6]{\frac{1}{\epsilon}}, \  \frac{\sqrt{2} \left(-1 - i\right)}{2}, \  \frac{\sqrt{2} \left(-1 + i\right)}{2}, \  \frac{\sqrt{2} \cdot \left(1 - i\right)}{2}, \  \frac{\sqrt{2} \cdot \left(1 + i\right)}{2}\right]} \]",polynomial_roots,list,0.1,"[(-0.7338996338110347-1.271151453416906j), (-0.7338996338110347+1.271151453416906j), (0.7338996338110347-1.271151453416906j), (0.7338996338110347+1.271151453416906j), (-1.4677992676220695+0j), (1.4677992676220695+0j), (-0.7071067811865476-0.7071067811865476j), (-0.7071067811865476+0.7071067811865476j), (0.7071067811865476-0.7071067811865476j), (0.7071067811865476+0.7071067811865476j)]","[-1.51133083+0.j         -0.67915601+1.28461455j -0.67915601-1.28461455j

"Consider the polynomial\[P(x) =\epsilon x^{9} + x^{5} + 1.\] 
Find approximate expressions for all roots of the polynomials in the limit of small positive $\epsilon$ and large positive $\epsilon$. Only a single term approximation to the root is required. ","Consider the problem to be of form $A+B+C=0$, with $A$, $B$, and $C$ corresponding to the three terms in $P(x)$ :$A=\epsilon x^{9};$ $B=x^{5};$ $C=1.$
We now consider the three possible dominant balances, solving for the roots in each case and evaluating whether each balance holds for large or for small $\epsilon$.\vspace{1em}

We start with the balance $A+B=0$, assuming that $|C|$ is negligible when compared to $|A|$ and $|B|$. Solving this for $x$ in terms of $\epsilon$ then gives us 4 non-zero roots: 
\[\epsilon x^{9} + x^{5}=0 \]\[ \implies \boxed{ x=\left[ - \sqrt[4]{- \frac{1}{\epsilon}}, \  \sqrt[4]{- \frac{1}{\epsilon}}, \  - i \sqrt[4]{- \frac{1}{\epsilon}}, \  i \sqrt[4]{- \frac{1}{\epsilon}}\right]}.\]
To verify the roots found for consistency with our initial assumption, we check that $|A|,|B|>>|C|$ holds for this root by substituting our found root expression for $x$ back into $A$, $B$, and $C$ and comparing their magnitudes. Using this method, we find that validity for small $\epsilon$ is True and validity for large $\epsilon$ is False.

\underline{Therefore, these roots are valid in the limit of small positive $\epsilon$ only.}\vspace{1em}

Next we examine the balance $B+C=0$, assuming that $|A|$ is negligible when compared to $|B|$ and $|C|$. Solving this for $x$ in terms of $\epsilon$ gives us 5 non-zero roots: \[x^{5} + 1=0\]\[ \implies\boxed{ x=\left[ -1, \  \frac{1}{4} + \frac{\sqrt{5}}{4} + \frac{\sqrt{-10 + 2 \sqrt{5}}}{4}, \  - \frac{\sqrt{5}}{4} + \frac{1}{4} - \frac{i \sqrt{50 - 10 \sqrt{5}}}{8} - \frac{i \sqrt{10 - 2 \sqrt{5}}}{8}, \  \frac{1}{4} + \frac{\sqrt{5}}{4} - \frac{i \sqrt{10 \sqrt{5} + 50}}{16} - \frac{i \sqrt{2 \sqrt{5} + 10}}{16} - \frac{i \sqrt{10 - 2 \sqrt{5}}}{16} + \frac{i \sqrt{50 - 10 \sqrt{5}}}{16}, \  - \frac{\sqrt{5}}{4} + \frac{1}{4} - \frac{\sqrt{-10 + 2 \sqrt{5}}}{16} + \frac{\sqrt{-10 - 2 \sqrt{5}}}{16} + \frac{\sqrt{-50 + 10 \sqrt{5}}}{16} + \frac{\sqrt{-50 - 10 \sqrt{5}}}{16}\right]}.\]

Finally, we examine the balance $A+C=0$, assuming that $|B|$ is negligible when compared to $|A|$ and $|C|$.

"Consider the polynomial\[P(x) =\epsilon x^{6} + x^{5} - 1.\] 
Find approximate expressions for all roots of the polynomials in the limit of small positive $\epsilon$ and large positive $\epsilon$. Only a single term approximation to the root is required. ","Consider the problem to be of form $A+B+C=0$, with $A$, $B$, and $C$ corresponding to the three terms in $P(x)$ :$A=\epsilon x^{6};$ $B=x^{5};$ $C=-1.$
We now consider the three possible dominant balances, solving for the roots in each case and evaluating whether each balance holds for large or for small $\epsilon$.\vspace{1em}

We start with the balance $A+B=0$, assuming that $|C|$ is negligible when compared to $|A|$ and $|B|$. Solving this for $x$ in terms of $\epsilon$ then gives us 1 non-zero root: 
\[\epsilon x^{6} + x^{5}=0 \]\[ \implies \boxed{ x=\left[ - \frac{1}{\epsilon}\right]}.\]
To verify the roots found for consistency with our initial assumption, we check that $|A|,|B|>>|C|$ holds for this root by substituting our found root expression for $x$ back into $A$, $B$, and $C$ and comparing their magnitudes. Using this method, we find that validity for small $\epsilon$ is True and validity for large $\epsilon$ is False.

\underline{Therefore, these roots are valid in the limit of small positive $\epsilon$ only.}\vspace{1em}

Next we examine the balance $B+C=0$, assuming that $|A|$ is negligible when compared to $|B|$ and $|C|$. Solving this for $x$ in terms of $\epsilon$ gives us 5 non-zero roots: \[x^{5} - 1=0\]\[ \implies\boxed{ x=\left[ 1, \  - \frac{1}{4} + \frac{\sqrt{5}}{4} - \frac{i \sqrt{2 \sqrt{5} + 10}}{4}, \  - \frac{1}{4} + \frac{\sqrt{5}}{4} + \frac{\sqrt{-10 - 2 \sqrt{5}}}{4}, \  - \frac{\sqrt{5}}{4} - \frac{1}{4} - \frac{i \sqrt{10 - 2 \sqrt{5}}}{4}, \  - \frac{\sqrt{5}}{4} - \frac{1}{4} + \frac{i \sqrt{10 - 2 \sqrt{5}}}{4}\right]}.\]

Finally, we examine the balance $A+C=0$, assuming that $|B|$ is negligible when compared to $|A|$ and $|C|$.

"Consider the polynomial\[P(x) =\epsilon x^{10} - x^{5} - 1.\] 
Find approximate expressions for all roots of the polynomials in the limit of small positive $\epsilon$ and large positive $\epsilon$. Only a single term approximation to the root is required. ","Consider the problem to be of form $A+B+C=0$, with $A$, $B$, and $C$ corresponding to the three terms in $P(x)$ :$A=\epsilon x^{10};$ $B=- x^{5};$ $C=-1.$
We now consider the three possible dominant balances, solving for the roots in each case and evaluating whether each balance holds for large or for small $\epsilon$.\vspace{1em}

We start with the balance $A+B=0$, assuming that $|C|$ is negligible when compared to $|A|$ and $|B|$. Solving this for $x$ in terms of $\epsilon$ then gives us 5 non-zero roots: 
\[\epsilon x^{10} - x^{5}=0 \]\[ \implies \boxed{ x=\left[ \frac{\left(- \sqrt{5} - 1 - \sqrt{2} \sqrt{-5 + \sqrt{5}}\right) \sqrt[5]{\frac{1}{\epsilon}}}{4}, \  \frac{\left(- \sqrt{5} - 1 + \sqrt{2} \sqrt{-5 + \sqrt{5}}\right) \sqrt[5]{\frac{1}{\epsilon}}}{4}, \  \frac{\left(-1 + \sqrt{5} - \sqrt{2} \sqrt{-5 - \sqrt{5}}\right) \sqrt[5]{\frac{1}{\epsilon}}}{4}, \  \frac{\left(-1 + \sqrt{5} + \sqrt{2} \sqrt{-5 - \sqrt{5}}\right) \sqrt[5]{\frac{1}{\epsilon}}}{4}, \  \sqrt[5]{\frac{1}{\epsilon}}\right]}.\]
To verify the roots found for consistency with our initial assumption, we check that $|A|,|B|>>|C|$ holds for this root by substituting our found root expression for $x$ back into $A$, $B$, and $C$ and comparing their magnitudes. Using this method, we find that validity for small $\epsilon$ is True and validity for large $\epsilon$ is False.

\underline{Therefore, these roots are valid in the limit of small positive $\epsilon$ only.}\vspace{1em}

Next we examine the balance $B+C=0$, assuming that $|A|$ is negligible when compared to $|B|$ and $|C|$. Solving this for $x$ in terms of $\epsilon$ gives us 5 non-zero roots: \[- x^{5} - 1=0\]\[ \implies\boxed{ x=\left[ -1, \  \frac{1}{4} + \frac{\sqrt{5}}{4} + \frac{\sqrt{-10 + 2 \sqrt{5}}}{4}, \  - \frac{\sqrt{5}}{4} + \frac{1}{4} - \frac{i \sqrt{50 - 10 \sqrt{5}}}{8} - \frac{i \sqrt{10 - 2 \sqrt{5}}}{8}, \  \frac{1}{4} + \frac{\sqrt{5}}{4} - \frac{i \sqrt{10 \sqrt{5} + 50}}{16} - \frac{i \sqrt{2 \sqrt{5} + 10}}{16} - \frac{i \sqrt{10 - 2 \sqrt{5}}}{16} + \frac{i \sqrt{50 - 10 \sqrt{5}}}{16}, \  - \frac{\sqrt{5}}{4} + \frac{1}{4} - \frac{\sqrt{-10 + 2 \sqrt{5}}}{16} + \frac{\sqrt{-10 - 2 \sqrt{5}}}{16} + \frac{\sqrt{-50 + 10 \sqrt{5}}}{16} + \frac{\sqrt{-50 - 10 \sqrt{5}}}{16}\right]}.\]

Finally, we examine the balance $A+C=0$, assuming that $|B|$ is negligible when compared to $|A|$ and $|C|$. Solving this for $x$ in terms of $\epsilon$ gives us 10 non-zero roots: \[\epsilon x^{10} - 1=0\]\[ \implies\boxed{ x=\left[ \frac{\left(- \sqrt{5} - 1 - \sqrt{2} \sqrt{-5 + \sqrt{5}}\right) \sqrt[10]{\frac{1}{\epsilon}}}{4}, \  \frac{\left(- \sqrt{5} - 1 + \sqrt{2} \sqrt{-5 + \sqrt{5}}\right) \sqrt[10]{\frac{1}{\epsilon}}}{4}, \  \frac{\left(- \sqrt{5} + 1 - \sqrt{2} \sqrt{-5 - \sqrt{5}}\right) \sqrt[10]{\frac{1}{\epsilon}}}{4}, \  \frac{\left(- \sqrt{5} + 1 + \sqrt{2} \sqrt{-5 - \sqrt{5}}\right) \sqrt[10]{\frac{1}{\epsilon}}}{4}, \  \frac{\left(-1 + \sqrt{5} - \sqrt{2} \sqrt{-5 - \sqrt{5}}\right) \sqrt[10]{\frac{1}{\epsilon}}}{4}, \  \frac{\left(-1 + \sqrt{5} + \sqrt{2} \sqrt{-5 - \sqrt{5}}\right) \sqrt[10]{\frac{1}{\epsilon}}}{4}, \  \frac{\left(1 + \sqrt{5} - \sqrt{2} \sqrt{-5 + \sqrt{5}}\right) \sqrt[10]{\frac{1}{\epsilon}}}{4}, \  \frac{\left(1 + \sqrt{5} + \sqrt{2} \sqrt{-5 + \sqrt{5}}\right) \sqrt[10]{\frac{1}{\epsilon}}}{4}, \  - \sqrt[10]{\frac{1}{\epsilon}}, \  \sqrt[10]{\frac{1}{\epsilon}}\right]}.\]

We expect that, in each $\epsilon$ regime, we have the same number of roots as the degree of the polynomial $P(x)$.

"Consider the polynomial\[P(x) =\epsilon x^{8} - x^{2} - 1.\] 
Find approximate expressions for all roots of the polynomials in the limit of small positive $\epsilon$ and large positive $\epsilon$. Only a single term approximation to the root is required. ","Consider the problem to be of form $A+B+C=0$, with $A$, $B$, and $C$ corresponding to the three terms in $P(x)$ :$A=\epsilon x^{8};$ $B=- x^{2};$ $C=-1.$
We now consider the three possible dominant balances, solving for the roots in each case and evaluating whether each balance holds for large or for small $\epsilon$.\vspace{1em}

We start with the balance $A+B=0$, assuming that $|C|$ is negligible when compared to $|A|$ and $|B|$. Solving this for $x$ in terms of $\epsilon$ then gives us 6 non-zero roots: 
\[\epsilon x^{8} - x^{2}=0 \]\[ \implies \boxed{ x=\left[ \frac{\left(-1 - \sqrt{3} i\right) \sqrt[6]{\frac{1}{\epsilon}}}{2}, \  \frac{\left(-1 + \sqrt{3} i\right) \sqrt[6]{\frac{1}{\epsilon}}}{2}, \  \frac{\left(1 - \sqrt{3} i\right) \sqrt[6]{\frac{1}{\epsilon}}}{2}, \  \frac{\left(1 + \sqrt{3} i\right) \sqrt[6]{\frac{1}{\epsilon}}}{2}, \  - \sqrt[6]{\frac{1}{\epsilon}}, \  \sqrt[6]{\frac{1}{\epsilon}}\right]}.\]
To verify the roots found for consistency with our initial assumption, we check that $|A|,|B|>>|C|$ holds for this root by substituting our found root expression for $x$ back into $A$, $B$, and $C$ and comparing their magnitudes. Using this method, we find that validity for small $\epsilon$ is True and validity for large $\epsilon$ is False.

\underline{Therefore, these roots are valid in the limit of small positive $\epsilon$ only.}\vspace{1em}

Next we examine the balance $B+C=0$, assuming that $|A|$ is negligible when compared to $|B|$ and $|C|$. Solving this for $x$ in terms of $\epsilon$ gives us 2 non-zero roots: \[- x^{2} - 1=0\]\[ \implies\boxed{ x=\left[ - i, \  i\right]}.\]
To verify the roots found for consistency with our initial assumption, we check that $|B|,|C|>>|A|$ holds for this root by substituting our found root expression for $x$ back into $A$, $B$, and $C$ and comparing their magnitudes. Using this method, we find that validity for small $\epsilon$ is True and validity for large $\epsilon$ is False.

\underline{Therefore, these roots are valid in the limit of small positive $\epsilon$ only.}\vspace{1em}

Finally, we examine the balance $A+C=0$, assuming that $|B|$ is negligible when compared to $|A|$ and $|C|$. Solving this for $x$ in terms of $\epsilon$ gives us 8 non-zero roots: \[\epsilon x^{8} - 1=0\]\[ \implies\boxed{ x=\left[ - i \sqrt[8]{\frac{1}{\epsilon}}, \  i \sqrt[8]{\frac{1}{\epsilon}}, \  \frac{\sqrt{2} \left(-1 - i\right) \sqrt[8]{\frac{1}{\epsilon}}}{2}, \  \frac{\sqrt{2} \left(-1 + i\right) \sqrt[8]{\frac{1}{\epsilon}}}{2}, \  \frac{\sqrt{2} \cdot \left(1 - i\right) \sqrt[8]{\frac{1}{\epsilon}}}{2}, \  \frac{\sqrt{2} \cdot \left(1 + i\right) \sqrt[8]{\frac{1}{\epsilon}}}{2}, \  - \sqrt[8]{\frac{1}{\epsilon}}, \  \sqrt[8]{\frac{1}{\epsilon}}\right]}.\]

Using this method, we find that validity for small $\epsilon$ is False and validity for large $\epsilon$ is True.

\underline{Therefore, these roots are valid in the limit of large positive $\epsilon$ only.}\vspace{1em}

We expect that, in each $\epsilon$ regime, we have the same number of roots as the degree of the polynomial $P(x)$. We have found a total of 16 roots, half of which are valid in the limit of small positive $\epsilon$ and the other half of which are valid in the limit of large positive $\epsilon$. This is expected given the degree of the polynomial. So, the roots of $P(x)$ for large positive $\epsilon$ are\[ \boxed{ \left[ - i \sqrt[8]{\frac{1}{\epsilon}}, \  i \sqrt[8]{\frac{1}{\epsilon}}, \  \frac{\sqrt{2} \left(-1 - i\right) \sqrt[8]{\frac{1}{\epsilon}}}{2}, \  \frac{\sqrt{2} \left(-1 + i\right) \sqrt[8]{\frac{1}{\epsilon}}}{2}, \  \frac{\sqrt{2} \cdot \left(1 - i\right) \sqrt[8]{\frac{1}{\epsilon}}}{2}, \  \frac{\sqrt{2} \cdot \left(1 + i\right) \sqrt[8]{\frac{1}{\epsilon}}}{2}, \  - \sqrt[8]{\frac{1}{\epsilon}}, \  \sqrt[8]{\frac{1}{\epsilon}}\right]} \]and the roots of $P(x)$ for small positive $\epsilon$ are\[ \boxed{ \left[ \frac{\left(-1 - \sqrt{3} i\right) \sqrt[6]{\frac{1}{\epsilon}}}{2}, \  \frac{\left(-1 + \sqrt{3} i\right) \sqrt[6]{\frac{1}{\epsilon}}}{2}, \  \frac{\left(1 - \sqrt{3} i\right) \sqrt[6]{\frac{1}{\epsilon}}}{2}, \  \frac{\left(1 + \sqrt{3} i\right) \sqrt[6]{\frac{1}{\epsilon}}}{2}, \  - \sqrt[6]{\frac{1}{\epsilon}}, \  \sqrt[6]{\frac{1}{\epsilon}}, \  - i, \  i\right]} \]",polynomial_roots,list,0.1,"[(-0.7338996338110347-1.271151453416906j), (-0.7338996338110347+1.271151453416906j), (0.7338996338110347-1.271151453416906j), (0.7338996338110347+1.271151453416906j), (-1.4677992676220695+0j), (1.4677992676220695+0j), -1j, 1j]","[-1.55496307e+00+0.j          1.55496307e+00+0.j

"Consider the following third-order ordinary differential equation:  $$y''' = - \frac{y}{24 x^{4} + 6 x^{2} + 3} + y'^{2} - \frac{y''}{5 x^{3} - 2 x^{2} - x + 2} - \frac{1}{12 x^{2} - \cos{\left(x \right)} + 11}$$

Find analytical expressions that approximate the solution of $y(x)$ in the small $x$ and large $x$ regimes.

","The dominant balance in the small x regime is given by $$\frac{d^{3}}{d x^{3}} y = - \frac{y}{24 x^{4} + 6 x^{2} + 3},$$ and the dominant balance in the large x regime is given by $$\frac{d^{3}}{d x^{3}} y = \left(\frac{d}{d x} y\right)^{2}$$
Using the dominant balance in the small x regime, the solution can be derived by     setting $x=0$, analytically solving the dominant balance equation     for y, and plugging in the initial conditions. The solution is thus $$y{\left(x \right)} = 1 - \frac{x^{3}}{18}$$ in the small x regime.

The solution for the large \( x \) regime uses an ansatz of the form 
$$ y = \alpha (x - x^*)^p, $$ 
where \( x^* \) is the divergence point. Plugging in the ansatz and solving for the terms yields 
$$
\alpha p \left(p - 2\right) \left(p - 1\right) \left(x - 11.4511451145115\right)^{p - 3} = \alpha^{2} p^{2} \left(x - 11.4511451145115\right)^{2 p - 2}
$$

After substituting the derivatives, the equation is reorganized to collect terms with respect to \( (x - x^*) \). This leads to an equation where the coefficients and powers of \( (x - x^*) \) are equated on both sides. Simplifying the equation gives us two separate equations, one for the coefficients and another for the powers of \( (x - x^*) \).

The coefficients' equation is:
$$
\alpha p \left(p - 2\right) \left(p - 1\right) = \alpha^{2} p^{2}
$$

The powers' equation is:
$$
p - 3 = 2 p - 2
$$

Solving this system of equations provides the values of \( \alpha \) and \( p \). 
A valid solution is identified if \( \alpha \) and \( p \) are both nonzero. 
In such a case, the solution for \( \alpha \) and \( p \) is found to be:
$$
\alpha = -6, \quad p = -1
$$

With these values, the integration constant \( C \) is determined by substituting 
a known point from the numerical solution into the ansatz. This yields the following equation for \( C \):
$$
63.9257998942671 = C + 66.6600000000007
$$

Solving this equation, we find the value of \( C \) to be:
$$
C = -2.7342001057336,

Find analytical expressions that approximate the solution of $y(x)$ in the small $x$ and large $x$ regimes.

","The dominant balance in the small x regime is given by $$\frac{d^{3}}{d x^{3}} y = \frac{1}{12 x^{3} + \cos{\left(x \right)} - 3},$$ and the dominant balance in the large x regime is given by $$\frac{d^{3}}{d x^{3}} y = \left(\frac{d}{d x} y\right)^{4}$$
Using the dominant balance in the small x regime, the solution can be derived by     setting $x=0$, analytically solving the dominant balance equation     for y, and plugging in the initial conditions. The solution is thus $$y{\left(x \right)} = 1 - \frac{x^{3}}{12}$$ in the small x regime.

The solution for the large \( x \) regime uses an ansatz of the form 
$$ y = \alpha (x - x^*)^p, $$ 
where \( x^* \) is the divergence point. Plugging in the ansatz and solving for the terms yields 
$$
\alpha p \left(p - 2\right) \left(p - 1\right) \left(x - 12.3412341234123\right)^{p - 3} = \alpha^{4} p^{4} \left(x - 12.3412341234123\right)^{4 p - 4}
$$

After substituting the derivatives, the equation is reorganized to collect terms with respect to \( (x - x^*) \). This leads to an equation where the coefficients and powers of \( (x - x^*) \) are equated on both sides. Simplifying the equation gives us two separate equations, one for the coefficients and another for the powers of \( (x - x^*) \).

The coefficients' equation is:
$$
\alpha p \left(p - 2\right) \left(p - 1\right) = \alpha^{4} p^{4}
$$

The powers' equation is:

p - 3 = 4 p - 4

Solving this system of equations provides the values of \( \alpha \) and \( p \). 
A valid solution is identified if \( \alpha \) and \( p \) are both nonzero. 
In such a case, the solution for \( \alpha \) and \( p \) is found to be:
$$
\alpha = \sqrt[3]{30}, \quad p = \frac{1}{3}

With these values, the integration constant \( C \) is determined by substituting

Solving this equation, we find the value of \( C \) to be:

Find analytical expressions that approximate the solution of $y(x)$ in the small $x$ and large $x$ regimes.

","The dominant balance in the small x regime is given by $$\frac{d^{3}}{d x^{3}} y = - 5 e^{- x},$$ and the dominant balance in the large x regime is given by $$\frac{d^{3}}{d x^{3}} y = \left(\frac{d}{d x} y\right)^{4}$$
Using the dominant balance in the small x regime, the solution can be derived by     setting $x=0$, analytically solving the dominant balance equation     for y, and plugging in the initial conditions. The solution is thus $$y{\left(x \right)} = 1 - \frac{5 x^{3}}{6}$$ in the small x regime.

The solution for the large \( x \) regime uses an ansatz of the form 
$$ y = \alpha (x - x^*)^p, $$ 
where \( x^* \) is the divergence point. Plugging in the ansatz and solving for the terms yields 
$$
\alpha p \left(p - 2\right) \left(p - 1\right) \left(x - 3.15031503150315\right)^{p - 3} = \alpha^{4} p^{4} \left(x - 3.15031503150315\right)^{4 p - 4}
$$

After substituting the derivatives, the equation is reorganized to collect terms with respect to \( (x - x^*) \). This leads to an equation where the coefficients and powers of \( (x - x^*) \) are equated on both sides. Simplifying the equation gives us two separate equations, one for the coefficients and another for the powers of \( (x - x^*) \).

The coefficients' equation is:
$$
\alpha p \left(p - 2\right) \left(p - 1\right) = \alpha^{4} p^{4}

The powers' equation is:

Solving this system of equations provides the values of \( \alpha \) and \( p \). 
A valid solution is identified if \( \alpha \) and \( p \) are both nonzero.

With these values, the integration constant \( C \) is determined by substituting

$$

Solving this equation, we find the value of \( C \) to be:
$$
C = 1.96499064107377,

so, the analytical approximation for the solution at large $x$ (near the divergence point) is given by

Find analytical expressions that approximate the solution of $y(x)$ in the small $x$ and large $x$ regimes.

","The dominant balance in the small x regime is given by $$\frac{d^{3}}{d x^{3}} y = e^{- x},$$ and the dominant balance in the large x regime is given by $$\frac{d^{3}}{d x^{3}} y = \left(\frac{d}{d x} y\right)^{2}$$
Using the dominant balance in the small x regime, the solution can be derived by     setting $x=0$, analytically solving the dominant balance equation     for y, and plugging in the initial conditions. The solution is thus $$y{\left(x \right)} = \frac{x^{3}}{6} + 1$$ in the small x regime.

The solution for the large \( x \) regime uses an ansatz of the form 
$$ y = \alpha (x - x^*)^p, $$ 
where \( x^* \) is the divergence point. Plugging in the ansatz and solving for the terms yields 
$$
\alpha p \left(p - 2\right) \left(p - 1\right) \left(x - 4.06040604060406\right)^{p - 3} = \alpha^{2} p^{2} \left(x - 4.06040604060406\right)^{2 p - 2}
$$

After substituting the derivatives, the equation is reorganized to collect terms with respect to \( (x - x^*) \). This leads to an equation where the coefficients and powers of \( (x - x^*) \) are equated on both sides. Simplifying the equation gives us two separate equations, one for the coefficients and another for the powers of \( (x - x^*) \).

The coefficients' equation is:
$$
\alpha p \left(p - 2\right) \left(p - 1\right) = \alpha^{2} p^{2}
$$

The powers' equation is:
$$
p - 3 = 2 p - 2
$$

Solving this system of equations provides the values of \( \alpha \) and \( p \). 
A valid solution is identified if \( \alpha \) and \( p \) are both nonzero. 
In such a case, the solution for \( \alpha \) and \( p \) is found to be:
$$
\alpha = -6, \quad p = -1
$$

With these values, the integration constant \( C \) is determined by substituting 
a known point from the numerical solution into the ansatz. This yields the following equation for \( C \):
$$
63.4848138842773 = C + 66.6599999999997
$$

Solving this equation, we find the value of \( C \) to be:
$$
C = -3.1751861157224,
$$

so, the analytical approximation for the solution at large $x$ (near the divergence point) is given by
$$
y = -6 (x - 4.06040604060406)^{-1} + (-3.1751861157224),

and the analytical approximation for the solution at small $x$ is given by
$$

where \( x^* \) is the divergence point. Plugging in the ansatz and solving for the terms yields 
$$
\alpha p \left(p - 2\right) \left(p - 1\right) \left(x - 7.85078507850785\right)^{p - 3} = \alpha^{4} p^{4} \left(x - 7.85078507850785\right)^{4 p - 4}
$$

After substituting the derivatives, the equation is reorganized to collect terms with respect to \( (x - x^*) \). This leads to an equation where the coefficients and powers of \( (x - x^*) \) are equated on both sides. Simplifying the equation gives us two separate equations, one for the coefficients and another for the powers of \( (x - x^*) \).

The coefficients' equation is:
$$
\alpha p \left(p - 2\right) \left(p - 1\right) = \alpha^{4} p^{4}
$$

The powers' equation is:
$$
p - 3 = 4 p - 4
$$

Solving this system of equations provides the values of \( \alpha \) and \( p \). 
A valid solution is identified if \( \alpha \) and \( p \) are both nonzero. 
In such a case, the solution for \( \alpha \) and \( p \) is found to be:
$$
\alpha = \sqrt[3]{30}, \quad p = \frac{1}{3}

With these values, the integration constant \( C \) is determined by substituting 
a known point from the numerical solution into the ansatz. This yields the following equation for \( C \):

$$

Solving this equation, we find the value of \( C \) to be:

C = 2.83129276577677,

so, the analytical approximation for the solution at large $x$ (near the divergence point) is given by
$$

$$ y = \alpha (x - x^*)^p, $$ 
where \( x^* \) is the divergence point. Plugging in the ansatz and solving for the terms yields 
$$
\alpha p \left(p - 2\right) \left(p - 1\right) \left(x - 9.82098209820982\right)^{p - 3} = \alpha^{2} p^{2} \left(x - 9.82098209820982\right)^{2 p - 2}
$$

After substituting the derivatives, the equation is reorganized to collect terms with respect to \( (x - x^*) \). This leads to an equation where the coefficients and powers of \( (x - x^*) \) are equated on both sides. Simplifying the equation gives us two separate equations, one for the coefficients and another for the powers of \( (x - x^*) \).

The coefficients' equation is:
$$
\alpha p \left(p - 2\right) \left(p - 1\right) = \alpha^{2} p^{2}
$$

The powers' equation is:
$$
p - 3 = 2 p - 2
$$

Solving this system of equations provides the values of \( \alpha \) and \( p \). 
A valid solution is identified if \( \alpha \) and \( p \) are both nonzero. 
In such a case, the solution for \( \alpha \) and \( p \) is found to be:
$$
\alpha = -6, \quad p = -1
$$

With these values, the integration constant \( C \) is determined by substituting 
a known point from the numerical solution into the ansatz. This yields the following equation for \( C \):
$$
63.2559581741805 = C + 66.6599999999993
$$

Solving this equation, we find the value of \( C \) to be:
$$
C = -3.4040418258188,
$$

so, the analytical approximation for the solution at large $x$ (near the divergence point) is given by
$$
y = -6 (x - 9.82098209820982)^{-1} + (-3.4040418258188),
$$

and the analytical approximation for the solution at small $x$ is given by

Consider the integral $I(\epsilon) = \int_0^{96.00} \frac{1}{\epsilon + 7.0 x^{8.0} + 15.0 x^{9.0} + 3.0 x^{12.0}} dx$. Develop analytical formulas that approximate $I(\epsilon)$ for different regimes of $\epsilon$.,"
    The integral is of the form $I(\epsilon) = \int_0^{96} \frac{1}{\epsilon + P(x)} dx$ where $P(x)$ is a polynomial. Thus, its value can be estimated as the product between a height and a width.
    Since the integrand is maximized at $x = 0$, the height can be set to $\frac{1}{\epsilon}$.

    For small $\epsilon$,
    we define the width as the point where the integrand becomes half of its maximum height.
    This corresponds to solving for $x$ given $P(x) = \epsilon$.
    Applying dominant balance, considering the term in $P(x)$ with the smallest degree, the width is approximated as $ \left( \frac{1}{7.0*\epsilon} \right)^{1/8.0} $.
    Therefore, the analytical approximation of the integral for small $\epsilon$ is $\boxed{I(\epsilon) = \frac{0.7841}{\epsilon^{0.875}}}$.

    For an intermediate regime where $\epsilon$ is large,
    we also define the width based on the term with the largest degree.
    The width is approximated as \( \left( \frac{1}{3.0*\epsilon} \right)^{1/12.0} \).

    If the width of the integral exceeds the range of integration, we consider one more regime for very large $\epsilon$.
    The width is then just the range of integration, so in this regime, the integral can be approximated as $\frac{L}{\epsilon}$.
    Therefore, the analytical approximation of the integral for very large $\epsilon$ is $\boxed{I(\epsilon) = \frac{96}{\epsilon}}$.

"Alice, a keen botanist and mathematician, is conducting research on the growth of a rare species of plant. She believes that the polynomial \[P(x) =\epsilon x^{4} + x^{2} - 1\] might hold the key to understanding the optimal conditions for the plant's growth. The roots of this polynomial represent critical points in the plant's development. By investigating how these roots change as $\epsilon$ varies, Alice hopes to gain insights into how the plant adapts to different environmental conditions, ultimately leading to more effective cultivation strategies.

"Suppose you are planning to become a beekeeper, and your mentor tells you that there is a `golden rule' to beekeeping: the revenue earned depends on the number of bees in a hive in a particular season, and is determined by a polynomial equation. The break-even populations of a hive are therefore the roots of the nondimensionalized polynomial, i.e., the points where $$\epsilon x^{5} + x^{2} + 1 = 0.$$

This equation arises as the balance between the revenue generated from the honey and other products created by the bees, represented by $x^2$ and the cost of maintaining the bees. This cost includes two components: the term given by $\epsilon x^5$ accounts for the nonlinear increase in expenses related hive maintenance as the bee population grows, while $1$ is the scaled fixed cost of operating the beekeeping business.

Use the method of dominant balance to calculate the bee populations in your hive at which you will break even.

Given this information, provide an approximate analytical formula for $I(\epsilon)$ at different regimes of the patient's metabolism $\epsilon$.","
    The integral is of the form $I(\epsilon) = \int_0^{55} \frac{1}{\epsilon + P(x)} dx$ where $P(x)$ is a polynomial. Thus, its value can be estimated as the product between a height and a width.
    Since the integrand is maximized at $x = 0$, the height can be set to $\frac{1}{\epsilon}$.

    For small $\epsilon$,
    we define the width as the point where the integrand becomes half of its maximum height.
    This corresponds to solving for $x$ given $P(x) = \epsilon$.
    Applying dominant balance, considering the term in $P(x)$ with the smallest degree, the width is approximated as $ \left( \frac{1}{6.0*\epsilon} \right)^{1/7.0} $.
    Therefore, the analytical approximation of the integral for small $\epsilon$ is $\boxed{I(\epsilon) = \frac{0.7742}{\epsilon^{0.8571}}}$.

    For an intermediate regime where $\epsilon$ is large,
    we also define the width based on the term with the largest degree.
    The width is approximated as \( \left( \frac{1}{5.0*\epsilon} \right)^{1/16.0} \).
    Therefore, the analytical approximation of the integral for large $\epsilon$ is $\boxed{I(\epsilon) = \frac{0.7946}{\epsilon^{0.8571}}}$.

    If the width of the integral exceeds the range of integration, we consider one more regime for very large $\epsilon$.
    The width is then just the range of integration, so in this regime, the integral can be approximated as $\frac{L}{\epsilon}$.
    Therefore, the analytical approximation of the integral for very large $\epsilon$ is $\boxed{I(\epsilon) = \frac{55}{\epsilon}}$.

    Altogether, the solutions at small, large, and very large $\epsilon$ are $\boxed{\frac{0.7742}{\epsilon^{0.8571}}, \frac{0.7946}{\epsilon^{0.8571}}, \frac{55}{\epsilon}}$.

"Consider the polynomial\[P(x) =\epsilon x^{10} + x^{7} - 1.\] 
Find first order approximations for all roots of the polynomial in the limit of small positive $\epsilon$ and large positive $\epsilon$. ","We begin by equating the polynomial to zero to solve for the roots: $P(x) = 0.00$ This problem can be rewritten in the form $A+B+C=0.00$, where: $A=\epsilon x^{10.00};$ $B=x^{7.00};$ $C=-1.00$

We find approximate solutions to the roots by considering the three possible dominant balances. For each dominant balance, we find the roots of the resulting equation and evaluate whether each balance is self-consistent for small or large positive $\epsilon$. \vspace{1.00em}

We start with the balance $A+B=0.00$, assuming that $|C|$ is negligible when compared to $|A|$ and $|B|$. Solving this for $x$ in terms of $\epsilon$ then gives us 3.00 non-zero roots: 
\[\epsilon x^{10.00} + x^{7.00}=0.00 \]\[ \implies \boxed{ x=\left[ \sqrt[3.00]{- \frac{1.00}{\epsilon}}, \  \frac{\sqrt[3.00]{- \frac{1.00}{\epsilon}} \left(-1.00 - \sqrt{3.00} i\right)}{2.00}, \  \frac{\sqrt[3.00]{- \frac{1.00}{\epsilon}} \left(-1.00 + \sqrt{3.00} i\right)}{2.00}\right].}\]
To verify that these roots are consistent with the assumption that $|A|, |B| \gg |C|,$ we substitute these found roots back into the terms $A$, $B$, and $C$ and compare their magnitudes. Using this method, we find that it is true that these roots are valid for small $\epsilon$, while validity for large $\epsilon$ is false.

\underline{Therefore, these roots are valid in the limit of small positive $\epsilon$ only.}\vspace{1.00em}

Next we examine the balance $B+C=0.00$, assuming that $|A|$ is negligible when compared to $|B|$ and $|C|$. Solving this for $x$ in terms of $\epsilon$ gives us 7.00 non-zero roots: \[x^{7.00} - 1.00=0.00\]\[ \implies\boxed{ x=\left[ 1.00, \  - e^{\frac{i \pi}{7.00}}, \  - e^{- \frac{i \pi}{7.00}}, \  e^{- \frac{2.00 i \pi}{7.00}}, \  e^{\frac{2.00 i \pi}{7.00}}, \  - \sin{\left(\frac{\pi}{14.00} \right)} - i \cos{\left(\frac{\pi}{14.00} \right)}, \  - \sin{\left(\frac{\pi}{14.00} \right)} + i \cos{\left(\frac{\pi}{14.00} \right)}\right].}\]
To verify that these roots are consistent with the assumption that $|B|, |C| \gg |A|,$ we substitute these found roots back into $A$, $B$, and $C$ and compare their magnitudes. Using this method, we find that it is true that these roots are valid for small $\epsilon$, while validity for large $\epsilon$ is false.

\underline{Therefore, these roots are valid in the limit of small positive $\epsilon$ only.}\vspace{1.00em}

Finally, we examine the balance $A+C=0.00$, assuming that $|B|$ is negligible when compared to $|A|$ and $|C|$. Solving this for $x$ in terms of $\epsilon$ gives us 10.00 non-zero roots: \[\epsilon x^{10.00} - 1.00=0.00\]\[ \implies\boxed{ x=\left[ \frac{\left(- \sqrt{5.00} - 1.00 - \sqrt{2.00} \sqrt{-5.00 + \sqrt{5.00}}\right) \sqrt[10.00]{\frac{1.00}{\epsilon}}}{4.00}, \  \frac{\left(- \sqrt{5.00} - 1.00 + \sqrt{2.00} \sqrt{-5.00 + \sqrt{5.00}}\right) \sqrt[10.00]{\frac{1.00}{\epsilon}}}{4.00}, \  \frac{\left(- \sqrt{5.00} + 1.00 - \sqrt{2.00} \sqrt{-5.00 - \sqrt{5.00}}\right) \sqrt[10.00]{\frac{1.00}{\epsilon}}}{4.00}, \  \frac{\left(- \sqrt{5.00} + 1.00 + \sqrt{2.00} \sqrt{-5.00 - \sqrt{5.00}}\right) \sqrt[10.00]{\frac{1.00}{\epsilon}}}{4.00}, \  \frac{\left(-1.00 + \sqrt{5.00} - \sqrt{2.00} \sqrt{-5.00 - \sqrt{5.00}}\right) \sqrt[10.00]{\frac{1.00}{\epsilon}}}{4.00}, \  \frac{\left(-1.00 + \sqrt{5.00} + \sqrt{2.00} \sqrt{-5.00 - \sqrt{5.00}}\right) \sqrt[10.00]{\frac{1.00}{\epsilon}}}{4.00}, \  \frac{\left(1.00 + \sqrt{5.00} - \sqrt{2.00} \sqrt{-5.00 + \sqrt{5.00}}\right) \sqrt[10.00]{\frac{1.00}{\epsilon}}}{4.00}, \  \frac{\left(1.00 + \sqrt{5.00} + \sqrt{2.00} \sqrt{-5.00 + \sqrt{5.00}}\right) \sqrt[10.00]{\frac{1.00}{\epsilon}}}{4.00}, \  - \sqrt[10.00]{\frac{1.00}{\epsilon}}, \  \sqrt[10.00]{\frac{1.00}{\epsilon}}\right].}\]
To verify that these roots are consistent with the assumption that $|A|, |C| \gg |B|,$ we substitute these found roots back into $A$, $B$, and $C$ and compare their magnitudes. Using this method, we find that it is false that these roots are valid for small $\epsilon$, while validity for large $\epsilon$ is true.

\underline{Therefore, these roots are valid in the limit of large positive $\epsilon$ only.}\vspace{1.00em}

By the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra, a polynomial of degree 10.00 has exactly 10.00 roots.

We start with the balance $A+B=0.00$, assuming that $|C|$ is negligible when compared to $|A|$ and $|B|$. Solving this for $x$ in terms of $\epsilon$ then gives us 1.00 non-zero root:

"Consider the polynomial\[P(x) =\epsilon x^{8} + x^{6} + 1.\] 
Find first order approximations for all roots of the polynomial in the limit of small positive $\epsilon$ and large positive $\epsilon$. ","We begin by equating the polynomial to zero to solve for the roots: $P(x) = 0.00$ This problem can be rewritten in the form $A+B+C=0.00$, where: $A=\epsilon x^{8.00};$ $B=x^{6.00};$ $C=1.00$

We find approximate solutions to the roots by considering the three possible dominant balances. For each dominant balance, we find the roots of the resulting equation and evaluate whether each balance is self-consistent for small or large positive $\epsilon$. \vspace{1.00em}

We start with the balance $A+B=0.00$, assuming that $|C|$ is negligible when compared to $|A|$ and $|B|$. Solving this for $x$ in terms of $\epsilon$ then gives us 2.00 non-zero roots: 
\[\epsilon x^{8.00} + x^{6.00}=0.00 \]\[ \implies \boxed{ x=\left[ - \sqrt{- \frac{1.00}{\epsilon}}, \  \sqrt{- \frac{1.00}{\epsilon}}\right].}\]
To verify that these roots are consistent with the assumption that $|A|, |B| \gg |C|,$ we substitute these found roots back into the terms $A$, $B$, and $C$ and compare their magnitudes. Using this method, we find that it is true that these roots are valid for small $\epsilon$, while validity for large $\epsilon$ is false.

\underline{Therefore, these roots are valid in the limit of small positive $\epsilon$ only.}\vspace{1.00em}

Next we examine the balance $B+C=0.00$, assuming that $|A|$ is negligible when compared to $|B|$ and $|C|$. Solving this for $x$ in terms of $\epsilon$ gives us 6.00 non-zero roots: \[x^{6.00} + 1.00=0.00\]\[ \implies\boxed{ x=\left[ - i, \  i, \  - \frac{\sqrt{3.00}}{2.00} - \frac{i}{2.00}, \  - \frac{\sqrt{3.00}}{2.00} + \frac{i}{2.00}, \  \frac{\sqrt{3.00}}{2.00} - \frac{i}{2.00}, \  \frac{\sqrt{3.00}}{2.00} + \frac{i}{2.00}\right].}\]

Finally, we examine the balance $A+C=0.00$, assuming that $|B|$ is negligible when compared to $|A|$ and $|C|$.

By the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra, a polynomial of degree 8.00 has exactly 8.00 roots. We have found 8.00 roots that are valid in the limit of small positive $\epsilon$ and 8.00 roots valid in the limit of large positive $\epsilon$. Our method therefore provides a complete solution to the problem, finding the correct number of roots in each $\epsilon$ regime.

"Consider the polynomial\[P(x) =\epsilon x^{10} + x^{3} + 1.\] 
Find first order approximations for all roots of the polynomial in the limit of small positive $\epsilon$ and large positive $\epsilon$. ","We begin by equating the polynomial to zero to solve for the roots: $P(x) = 0.00$ This problem can be rewritten in the form $A+B+C=0.00$, where: $A=\epsilon x^{10.00};$ $B=x^{3.00};$ $C=1.00$

We find approximate solutions to the roots by considering the three possible dominant balances. For each dominant balance, we find the roots of the resulting equation and evaluate whether each balance is self-consistent for small or large positive $\epsilon$. \vspace{1.00em}

We start with the balance $A+B=0.00$, assuming that $|C|$ is negligible when compared to $|A|$ and $|B|$. Solving this for $x$ in terms of $\epsilon$ then gives us 7.00 non-zero roots: 
\[\epsilon x^{10.00} + x^{3.00}=0.00 \]\[ \implies \boxed{ x=\left[ \sqrt[7.00]{- \frac{1.00}{\epsilon}}, \  - \sqrt[7.00]{- \frac{1.00}{\epsilon}} e^{\frac{i \pi}{7.00}}, \  - \sqrt[7.00]{- \frac{1.00}{\epsilon}} e^{- \frac{i \pi}{7.00}}, \  \sqrt[7.00]{- \frac{1.00}{\epsilon}} e^{- \frac{2.00 i \pi}{7.00}}, \  \sqrt[7.00]{- \frac{1.00}{\epsilon}} e^{\frac{2.00 i \pi}{7.00}}, \  - \sqrt[7.00]{- \frac{1.00}{\epsilon}} \left(\sin{\left(\frac{\pi}{14.00} \right)} + i \cos{\left(\frac{\pi}{14.00} \right)}\right), \  \sqrt[7.00]{- \frac{1.00}{\epsilon}} \left(- \sin{\left(\frac{\pi}{14.00} \right)} + i \cos{\left(\frac{\pi}{14.00} \right)}\right)\right].}\]
To verify that these roots are consistent with the assumption that $|A|, |B| \gg |C|,$ we substitute these found roots back into the terms $A$, $B$, and $C$ and compare their magnitudes.

","We begin by equating the polynomial to zero to solve for the roots: $P(x) = 0.00$ This problem can be rewritten in the form $A+B+C=0.00$, where: $A=\epsilon x^{5.00};$ $B=x^{3.00};$ $C=1.00$

We find approximate solutions to the roots by considering the three possible dominant balances. For each dominant balance, we find the roots of the resulting equation and evaluate whether each balance is self-consistent for small or large positive $\epsilon$. \vspace{1.00em}

We start with the balance $A+B=0.00$, assuming that $|C|$ is negligible when compared to $|A|$ and $|B|$. Solving this for $x$ in terms of $\epsilon$ then gives us 2.00 non-zero roots: 
\[\epsilon x^{5.00} + x^{3.00}=0.00 \]\[ \implies \boxed{ x=\left[ - \sqrt{- \frac{1.00}{\epsilon}}, \  \sqrt{- \frac{1.00}{\epsilon}}\right].}\]
To verify that these roots are consistent with the assumption that $|A|, |B| \gg |C|,$ we substitute these found roots back into the terms $A$, $B$, and $C$ and compare their magnitudes. Using this method, we find that it is true that these roots are valid for small $\epsilon$, while validity for large $\epsilon$ is false.

\underline{Therefore, these roots are valid in the limit of small positive $\epsilon$ only.}\vspace{1.00em}

Next we examine the balance $B+C=0.00$, assuming that $|A|$ is negligible when compared to $|B|$ and $|C|$. Solving this for $x$ in terms of $\epsilon$ gives us 3.00 non-zero roots: \[x^{3.00} + 1.00=0.00\]\[ \implies\boxed{ x=\left[ -1.00, \  \frac{1.00}{2.00} - \frac{\sqrt{3.00} i}{2.00}, \  \frac{1.00}{2.00} + \frac{\sqrt{3.00} i}{2.00}\right].}\]
To verify that these roots are consistent with the assumption that $|B|, |C| \gg |A|,$ we substitute these found roots back into $A$, $B$, and $C$ and compare their magnitudes. Using this method, we find that it is true that these roots are valid for small $\epsilon$, while validity for large $\epsilon$ is false.

\underline{Therefore, these roots are valid in the limit of small positive $\epsilon$ only.}\vspace{1.00em}

Finally, we examine the balance $A+C=0.00$, assuming that $|B|$ is negligible when compared to $|A|$ and $|C|$. Solving this for $x$ in terms of $\epsilon$ gives us 5.00 non-zero roots: \[\epsilon x^{5.00} + 1.00=0.00\]\[ \implies\boxed{ x=\left[ \sqrt[5.00]{- \frac{1.00}{\epsilon}}, \  \frac{\sqrt[5.00]{- \frac{1.00}{\epsilon}} \left(-1.00 + \sqrt{5.00} - \sqrt{2.00} \sqrt{-5.00 - \sqrt{5.00}}\right)}{4.00}, \  \frac{\sqrt[5.00]{- \frac{1.00}{\epsilon}} \left(-1.00 + \sqrt{5.00} + \sqrt{2.00} \sqrt{-5.00 - \sqrt{5.00}}\right)}{4.00}, \  \frac{\sqrt[5.00]{- \frac{1.00}{\epsilon}} \left(- \sqrt{5.00} - 1.00 - \sqrt{2.00} \sqrt{-5.00 + \sqrt{5.00}}\right)}{4.00}, \  \frac{\sqrt[5.00]{- \frac{1.00}{\epsilon}} \left(- \sqrt{5.00} - 1.00 + \sqrt{2.00} \sqrt{-5.00 + \sqrt{5.00}}\right)}{4.00}\right].}\]
To verify that these roots are consistent with the assumption that $|A|, |C| \gg |B|,$ we substitute these found roots back into $A$, $B$, and $C$ and compare their magnitudes. Using this method, we find that it is false that these roots are valid for small $\epsilon$, while validity for large $\epsilon$ is true.

\underline{Therefore, these roots are valid in the limit of large positive $\epsilon$ only.}\vspace{1.00em}

By the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra, a polynomial of degree 5.00 has exactly 5.00 roots. We have found 5.00 roots that are valid in the limit of small positive $\epsilon$ and 5.00 roots valid in the limit of large positive $\epsilon$. Our method therefore provides a complete solution to the problem, finding the correct number of roots in each $\epsilon$ regime.

"Consider the polynomial\[P(x) =\epsilon x^{10} + x^{4} + 1.\] 
Find first order approximations for all roots of the polynomial in the limit of small positive $\epsilon$ and large positive $\epsilon$. ","We begin by equating the polynomial to zero to solve for the roots: $P(x) = 0.00$ This problem can be rewritten in the form $A+B+C=0.00$, where: $A=\epsilon x^{10.00};$ $B=x^{4.00};$ $C=1.00$

We find approximate solutions to the roots by considering the three possible dominant balances. For each dominant balance, we find the roots of the resulting equation and evaluate whether each balance is self-consistent for small or large positive $\epsilon$. \vspace{1.00em}

We start with the balance $A+B=0.00$, assuming that $|C|$ is negligible when compared to $|A|$ and $|B|$. Solving this for $x$ in terms of $\epsilon$ then gives us 6.00 non-zero roots: 
\[\epsilon x^{10.00} + x^{4.00}=0.00 \]\[ \implies \boxed{ x=\left[ - \sqrt[6.00]{- \frac{1.00}{\epsilon}}, \  \sqrt[6.00]{- \frac{1.00}{\epsilon}}, \  \frac{\sqrt[6.00]{- \frac{1.00}{\epsilon}} \left(-1.00 - \sqrt{3.00} i\right)}{2.00}, \  \frac{\sqrt[6.00]{- \frac{1.00}{\epsilon}} \left(-1.00 + \sqrt{3.00} i\right)}{2.00}, \  \frac{\sqrt[6.00]{- \frac{1.00}{\epsilon}} \left(1.00 - \sqrt{3.00} i\right)}{2.00}, \  \frac{\sqrt[6.00]{- \frac{1.00}{\epsilon}} \left(1.00 + \sqrt{3.00} i\right)}{2.00}\right].}\]
To verify that these roots are consistent with the assumption that $|A|, |B| \gg |C|,$ we substitute these found roots back into the terms $A$, $B$, and $C$ and compare their magnitudes. Using this method, we find that it is true that these roots are valid for small $\epsilon$, while validity for large $\epsilon$ is false.

\underline{Therefore, these roots are valid in the limit of small positive $\epsilon$ only.}\vspace{1.00em}

Next we examine the balance $B+C=0.00$, assuming that $|A|$ is negligible when compared to $|B|$ and $|C|$. Solving this for $x$ in terms of $\epsilon$ gives us 4.00 non-zero roots: \[x^{4.00} + 1.00=0.00\]\[ \implies\boxed{ x=\left[ \frac{\sqrt{2.00} \left(-1.00 - i\right)}{2.00}, \  \frac{\sqrt{2.00} \left(-1.00 + i\right)}{2.00}, \  \frac{\sqrt{2.00} \cdot \left(1.00 - i\right)}{2.00}, \  \frac{\sqrt{2.00} \cdot \left(1.00 + i\right)}{2.00}\right].}\]

","We begin by equating the polynomial to zero to solve for the roots: $P(x) = 0.00$ This problem can be rewritten in the form $A+B+C=0.00$, where: $A=\epsilon x^{2.00};$ $B=- x;$ $C=-1.00$

We find approximate solutions to the roots by considering the three possible dominant balances. For each dominant balance, we find the roots of the resulting equation and evaluate whether each balance is self-consistent for small or large positive $\epsilon$. \vspace{1.00em}

We start with the balance $A+B=0.00$, assuming that $|C|$ is negligible when compared to $|A|$ and $|B|$. Solving this for $x$ in terms of $\epsilon$ then gives us 1.00 non-zero root: 
\[\epsilon x^{2.00} - x=0.00 \]\[ \implies \boxed{ x=\left[ \frac{1.00}{\epsilon}\right].}\]
To verify that these roots are consistent with the assumption that $|A|, |B| \gg |C|,$ we substitute these found roots back into the terms $A$, $B$, and $C$ and compare their magnitudes. Using this method, we find that it is true that these roots are valid for small $\epsilon$, while validity for large $\epsilon$ is false.

Find first order approximations for all roots of the polynomial in the limit of small positive $\epsilon$ and large positive $\epsilon$.

We find approximate solutions to the roots by considering the three possible dominant balances. For each dominant balance, we find the roots of the resulting equation and evaluate whether each balance is self-consistent for small or large positive $\epsilon$. \vspace{1.00em}

We start with the balance $A+B=0.00$, assuming that $|C|$ is negligible when compared to $|A|$ and $|B|$. Solving this for $x$ in terms of $\epsilon$ then gives us 3.00 non-zero roots:

\[\epsilon x^{9.00} + x^{2.00}=0.00 \]\[ \implies \boxed{ x=\left[ \sqrt[7.00]{- \frac{1.00}{\epsilon}}, \  - \sqrt[7.00]{- \frac{1.00}{\epsilon}} e^{\frac{i \pi}{7.00}}, \  - \sqrt[7.00]{- \frac{1.00}{\epsilon}} e^{- \frac{i \pi}{7.00}}, \  \sqrt[7.00]{- \frac{1.00}{\epsilon}} e^{- \frac{2.00 i \pi}{7.00}}, \  \sqrt[7.00]{- \frac{1.00}{\epsilon}} e^{\frac{2.00 i \pi}{7.00}}, \  - \sqrt[7.00]{- \frac{1.00}{\epsilon}} \left(\sin{\left(\frac{\pi}{14.00} \right)} + i \cos{\left(\frac{\pi}{14.00} \right)}\right), \  \sqrt[7.00]{- \frac{1.00}{\epsilon}} \left(- \sin{\left(\frac{\pi}{14.00} \right)} + i \cos{\left(\frac{\pi}{14.00} \right)}\right)\right].}\]
To verify that these roots are consistent with the assumption that $|A|, |B| \gg |C|,$ we substitute these found roots back into the terms $A$, $B$, and $C$ and compare their magnitudes. Using this method, we find that it is true that these roots are valid for small $\epsilon$, while validity for large $\epsilon$ is false.

\underline{Therefore, these roots are valid in the limit of small positive $\epsilon$ only.}\vspace{1.00em}

Next we examine the balance $B+C=0.00$, assuming that $|A|$ is negligible when compared to $|B|$ and $|C|$. Solving this for $x$ in terms of $\epsilon$ gives us 2.00 non-zero roots: \[x^{2.00} + 1.00=0.00\]\[ \implies\boxed{ x=\left[ - i, \  i\right].}\]

Finally, we examine the balance $A+C=0.00$, assuming that $|B|$ is negligible when compared to $|A|$ and $|C|$. Solving this for $x$ in terms of $\epsilon$ gives us 9.00 non-zero roots: \[\epsilon x^{9.00} + 1.00=0.00\]\[ \implies\boxed{ x=\left[ \sqrt[9.00]{- \frac{1.00}{\epsilon}}, \  \frac{\sqrt[9.00]{- \frac{1.00}{\epsilon}} \left(-1.00 - \sqrt{3.00} i\right)}{2.00}, \  \frac{\sqrt[9.00]{- \frac{1.00}{\epsilon}} \left(-1.00 + \sqrt{3.00} i\right)}{2.00}, \  - \sqrt[9.00]{- \frac{1.00}{\epsilon}} e^{\frac{i \pi}{9.00}}, \  - \sqrt[9.00]{- \frac{1.00}{\epsilon}} e^{- \frac{i \pi}{9.00}}, \  \sqrt[9.00]{- \frac{1.00}{\epsilon}} e^{- \frac{2.00 i \pi}{9.00}}, \  \sqrt[9.00]{- \frac{1.00}{\epsilon}} e^{\frac{2.00 i \pi}{9.00}}, \  \sqrt[9.00]{- \frac{1.00}{\epsilon}} \left(\sin{\left(\frac{\pi}{18.00} \right)} - i \cos{\left(\frac{\pi}{18.00} \right)}\right), \  \sqrt[9.00]{- \frac{1.00}{\epsilon}} \left(\sin{\left(\frac{\pi}{18.00} \right)} + i \cos{\left(\frac{\pi}{18.00} \right)}\right)\right].}\]
To verify that these roots are consistent with the assumption that $|A|, |C| \gg |B|,$ we substitute these found roots back into $A$, $B$, and $C$ and compare their magnitudes.

\underline{Therefore, these roots are valid in the limit of large positive $\epsilon$ only.}\vspace{1.00em}

By the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra, a polynomial of degree 9.00 has exactly 9.00 roots. We have found 9.00 roots that are valid in the limit of small positive $\epsilon$ and 9.00 roots valid in the limit of large positive $\epsilon$. Our method therefore provides a complete solution to the problem, finding the correct number of roots in each $\epsilon$ regime. 

The roots of $P(x)$ for large positive $\epsilon$ are\[ \boxed{ \left[ \sqrt[9.00]{- \frac{1.00}{\epsilon}}, \  \frac{\sqrt[9.00]{- \frac{1.00}{\epsilon}} \left(-1.00 - \sqrt{3.00} i\right)}{2.00}, \  \frac{\sqrt[9.00]{- \frac{1.00}{\epsilon}} \left(-1.00 + \sqrt{3.00} i\right)}{2.00}, \  - \sqrt[9.00]{- \frac{1.00}{\epsilon}} e^{\frac{i \pi}{9.00}}, \  - \sqrt[9.00]{- \frac{1.00}{\epsilon}} e^{- \frac{i \pi}{9.00}}, \  \sqrt[9.00]{- \frac{1.00}{\epsilon}} e^{- \frac{2.00 i \pi}{9.00}}, \  \sqrt[9.00]{- \frac{1.00}{\epsilon}} e^{\frac{2.00 i \pi}{9.00}}, \  \sqrt[9.00]{- \frac{1.00}{\epsilon}} \left(\sin{\left(\frac{\pi}{18.00} \right)} - i \cos{\left(\frac{\pi}{18.00} \right)}\right), \  \sqrt[9.00]{- \frac{1.00}{\epsilon}} \left(\sin{\left(\frac{\pi}{18.00} \right)} + i \cos{\left(\frac{\pi}{18.00} \right)}\right)\right]} \]and the roots of $P(x)$ for small positive $\epsilon$ are\[ \boxed{ \left[ \sqrt[7.00]{- \frac{1.00}{\epsilon}}, \  - \sqrt[7.00]{- \frac{1.00}{\epsilon}} e^{\frac{i \pi}{7.00}}, \  - \sqrt[7.00]{- \frac{1.00}{\epsilon}} e^{- \frac{i \pi}{7.00}}, \  \sqrt[7.00]{- \frac{1.00}{\epsilon}} e^{- \frac{2.00 i \pi}{7.00}}, \  \sqrt[7.00]{- \frac{1.00}{\epsilon}} e^{\frac{2.00 i \pi}{7.00}}, \  - \sqrt[7.00]{- \frac{1.00}{\epsilon}} \left(\sin{\left(\frac{\pi}{14.00} \right)} + i \cos{\left(\frac{\pi}{14.00} \right)}\right), \  \sqrt[7.00]{- \frac{1.00}{\epsilon}} \left(- \sin{\left(\frac{\pi}{14.00} \right)} + i \cos{\left(\frac{\pi}{14.00} \right)}\right), \  - i, \  i\right]} \]",polynomial_roots,list,0.01,"[[(1.7394985470537137+0.837698349713642j), (-1.2037703444305243-1.5094802675704497j), (-1.93069772888325+0j), (1.7394985470537137-0.837698349713642j), (0.4296206618184359+1.8822911058743355j), (0.4296206618184359-1.8822911058743355j), (-1.2037703444305243+1.5094802675704497j), -1j, 1j]]","[-1.99360127+0.j         -1.26042927+1.46127334j -1.26042927-1.46127334j

"Consider the polynomial\[P(x) =\epsilon x^{9} - x^{6} + 1.\] 
Find first order approximations for all roots of the polynomial in the limit of small positive $\epsilon$ and large positive $\epsilon$. ","We begin by equating the polynomial to zero to solve for the roots: $P(x) = 0.00$ This problem can be rewritten in the form $A+B+C=0.00$, where: $A=\epsilon x^{9.00};$ $B=- x^{6.00};$ $C=1.00$

We find approximate solutions to the roots by considering the three possible dominant balances. For each dominant balance, we find the roots of the resulting equation and evaluate whether each balance is self-consistent for small or large positive $\epsilon$. \vspace{1.00em}

We start with the balance $A+B=0.00$, assuming that $|C|$ is negligible when compared to $|A|$ and $|B|$. Solving this for $x$ in terms of $\epsilon$ then gives us 3.00 non-zero roots: 
\[\epsilon x^{9.00} - x^{6.00}=0.00 \]\[ \implies \boxed{ x=\left[ \frac{\left(-1.00 - \sqrt{3.00} i\right) \sqrt[3.00]{\frac{1.00}{\epsilon}}}{2.00}, \  \frac{\left(-1.00 + \sqrt{3.00} i\right) \sqrt[3.00]{\frac{1.00}{\epsilon}}}{2.00}, \  \sqrt[3.00]{\frac{1.00}{\epsilon}}\right].}\]
To verify that these roots are consistent with the assumption that $|A|, |B| \gg |C|,$ we substitute these found roots back into the terms $A$, $B$, and $C$ and compare their magnitudes. Using this method, we find that it is true that these roots are valid for small $\epsilon$, while validity for large $\epsilon$ is false.

\underline{Therefore, these roots are valid in the limit of small positive $\epsilon$ only.}\vspace{1.00em}

Next we examine the balance $B+C=0.00$, assuming that $|A|$ is negligible when compared to $|B|$ and $|C|$. Solving this for $x$ in terms of $\epsilon$ gives us 6.00 non-zero roots: \[1.00 - x^{6.00}=0.00\]\[ \implies\boxed{ x=\left[ -1.00, \  1.00, \  - \frac{1.00}{2.00} - \frac{\sqrt{3.00} i}{2.00}, \  - \frac{1.00}{2.00} + \frac{\sqrt{3.00} i}{2.00}, \  \frac{1.00}{2.00} - \frac{\sqrt{3.00} i}{2.00}, \  \frac{1.00}{2.00} + \frac{\sqrt{3.00} i}{2.00}\right].}\]

Finally, we examine the balance $A+C=0.00$, assuming that $|B|$ is negligible when compared to $|A|$ and $|C|$. Solving this for $x$ in terms of $\epsilon$ gives us 9.00 non-zero roots: \[\epsilon x^{9.00} + 1.00=0.00\]\[ \implies\boxed{ x=\left[ \sqrt[9.00]{- \frac{1.00}{\epsilon}}, \  \frac{\sqrt[9.00]{- \frac{1.00}{\epsilon}} \left(-1.00 - \sqrt{3.00} i\right)}{2.00}, \  \frac{\sqrt[9.00]{- \frac{1.00}{\epsilon}} \left(-1.00 + \sqrt{3.00} i\right)}{2.00}, \  - \sqrt[9.00]{- \frac{1.00}{\epsilon}} e^{\frac{i \pi}{9.00}}, \  - \sqrt[9.00]{- \frac{1.00}{\epsilon}} e^{- \frac{i \pi}{9.00}}, \  \sqrt[9.00]{- \frac{1.00}{\epsilon}} e^{- \frac{2.00 i \pi}{9.00}}, \  \sqrt[9.00]{- \frac{1.00}{\epsilon}} e^{\frac{2.00 i \pi}{9.00}}, \  \sqrt[9.00]{- \frac{1.00}{\epsilon}} \left(\sin{\left(\frac{\pi}{18.00} \right)} - i \cos{\left(\frac{\pi}{18.00} \right)}\right), \  \sqrt[9.00]{- \frac{1.00}{\epsilon}} \left(\sin{\left(\frac{\pi}{18.00} \right)} + i \cos{\left(\frac{\pi}{18.00} \right)}\right)\right].}\]
To verify that these roots are consistent with the assumption that $|A|, |C| \gg |B|,$ we substitute these found roots back into $A$, $B$, and $C$ and compare their magnitudes.

By the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra, a polynomial of degree 9.00 has exactly 9.00 roots. We have found 9.00 roots that are valid in the limit of small positive $\epsilon$ and 9.00 roots valid in the limit of large positive $\epsilon$. Our method therefore provides a complete solution to the problem, finding the correct number of roots in each $\epsilon$ regime.

Find first order approximations for all roots of the polynomial in the limit of small positive $\epsilon$ and large positive $\epsilon$.

"Consider the polynomial\[P(x) =\epsilon x^{8} - x^{2} + 1.\] 
Find first order approximations for all roots of the polynomial in the limit of small positive $\epsilon$ and large positive $\epsilon$. ","We begin by equating the polynomial to zero to solve for the roots: $P(x) = 0.00$ This problem can be rewritten in the form $A+B+C=0.00$, where: $A=\epsilon x^{8.00};$ $B=- x^{2.00};$ $C=1.00$

We find approximate solutions to the roots by considering the three possible dominant balances. For each dominant balance, we find the roots of the resulting equation and evaluate whether each balance is self-consistent for small or large positive $\epsilon$. \vspace{1.00em}

We start with the balance $A+B=0.00$, assuming that $|C|$ is negligible when compared to $|A|$ and $|B|$. Solving this for $x$ in terms of $\epsilon$ then gives us 6.00 non-zero roots: 
\[\epsilon x^{8.00} - x^{2.00}=0.00 \]\[ \implies \boxed{ x=\left[ \frac{\left(-1.00 - \sqrt{3.00} i\right) \sqrt[6.00]{\frac{1.00}{\epsilon}}}{2.00}, \  \frac{\left(-1.00 + \sqrt{3.00} i\right) \sqrt[6.00]{\frac{1.00}{\epsilon}}}{2.00}, \  \frac{\left(1.00 - \sqrt{3.00} i\right) \sqrt[6.00]{\frac{1.00}{\epsilon}}}{2.00}, \  \frac{\left(1.00 + \sqrt{3.00} i\right) \sqrt[6.00]{\frac{1.00}{\epsilon}}}{2.00}, \  - \sqrt[6.00]{\frac{1.00}{\epsilon}}, \  \sqrt[6.00]{\frac{1.00}{\epsilon}}\right].}\]
To verify that these roots are consistent with the assumption that $|A|, |B| \gg |C|,$ we substitute these found roots back into the terms $A$, $B$, and $C$ and compare their magnitudes. Using this method, we find that it is true that these roots are valid for small $\epsilon$, while validity for large $\epsilon$ is false.

\underline{Therefore, these roots are valid in the limit of small positive $\epsilon$ only.}\vspace{1.00em}

Next we examine the balance $B+C=0.00$, assuming that $|A|$ is negligible when compared to $|B|$ and $|C|$. Solving this for $x$ in terms of $\epsilon$ gives us 2.00 non-zero roots: \[1.00 - x^{2.00}=0.00\]\[ \implies\boxed{ x=\left[ -1.00, \  1.00\right].}\]
To verify that these roots are consistent with the assumption that $|B|, |C| \gg |A|,$ we substitute these found roots back into $A$, $B$, and $C$ and compare their magnitudes.

Finally, we examine the balance $A+C=0.00$, assuming that $|B|$ is negligible when compared to $|A|$ and $|C|$. Solving this for $x$ in terms of $\epsilon$ gives us 8.00 non-zero roots: \[\epsilon x^{8.00} + 1.00=0.00\]\[ \implies\boxed{ x=\left[ - \sqrt[8.00]{- \frac{1.00}{\epsilon}}, \  \sqrt[8.00]{- \frac{1.00}{\epsilon}}, \  - i \sqrt[8.00]{- \frac{1.00}{\epsilon}}, \  i \sqrt[8.00]{- \frac{1.00}{\epsilon}}, \  \frac{\sqrt{2.00} \sqrt[8.00]{- \frac{1.00}{\epsilon}} \left(-1.00 - i\right)}{2.00}, \  \frac{\sqrt{2.00} \sqrt[8.00]{- \frac{1.00}{\epsilon}} \left(-1.00 + i\right)}{2.00}, \  \frac{\sqrt{2.00} \sqrt[8.00]{- \frac{1.00}{\epsilon}} \left(1.00 - i\right)}{2.00}, \  \frac{\sqrt{2.00} \sqrt[8.00]{- \frac{1.00}{\epsilon}} \left(1.00 + i\right)}{2.00}\right].}\]
To verify that these roots are consistent with the assumption that $|A|, |C| \gg |B|,$ we substitute these found roots back into $A$, $B$, and $C$ and compare their magnitudes.

\underline{Therefore, these roots are valid in the limit of large positive $\epsilon$ only.}\vspace{1.00em}

By the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra, a polynomial of degree 8.00 has exactly 8.00 roots. We have found 8.00 roots that are valid in the limit of small positive $\epsilon$ and 8.00 roots valid in the limit of large positive $\epsilon$. Our method therefore provides a complete solution to the problem, finding the correct number of roots in each $\epsilon$ regime.

We find approximate solutions to the roots by considering the three possible dominant balances. For each dominant balance, we find the roots of the resulting equation and evaluate whether each balance is self-consistent for small or large positive $\epsilon$. \vspace{1.00em}

We start with the balance $A+B=0.00$, assuming that $|C|$ is negligible when compared to $|A|$ and $|B|$. Solving this for $x$ in terms of $\epsilon$ then gives us 3.00 non-zero roots: 
\[\epsilon x^{4.00} - x=0.00 \]\[ \implies \boxed{ x=\left[ \frac{\left(-1.00 - \sqrt{3.00} i\right) \sqrt[3.00]{\frac{1.00}{\epsilon}}}{2.00}, \  \frac{\left(-1.00 + \sqrt{3.00} i\right) \sqrt[3.00]{\frac{1.00}{\epsilon}}}{2.00}, \  \sqrt[3.00]{\frac{1.00}{\epsilon}}\right].}\]
To verify that these roots are consistent with the assumption that $|A|, |B| \gg |C|,$ we substitute these found roots back into the terms $A$, $B$, and $C$ and compare their magnitudes. Using this method, we find that it is true that these roots are valid for small $\epsilon$, while validity for large $\epsilon$ is false.

\underline{Therefore, these roots are valid in the limit of small positive $\epsilon$ only.}\vspace{1.00em}

Next we examine the balance $B+C=0.00$, assuming that $|A|$ is negligible when compared to $|B|$ and $|C|$. Solving this for $x$ in terms of $\epsilon$ gives us 1.00 non-zero root: \[1.00 - x=0.00\]\[ \implies\boxed{ x=\left[ 1.00\right].}\]
To verify that these roots are consistent with the assumption that $|B|, |C| \gg |A|,$ we substitute these found roots back into $A$, $B$, and $C$ and compare their magnitudes.

Finally, we examine the balance $A+C=0.00$, assuming that $|B|$ is negligible when compared to $|A|$ and $|C|$. Solving this for $x$ in terms of $\epsilon$ gives us 4.00 non-zero roots: \[\epsilon x^{4.00} + 1.00=0.00\]\[ \implies\boxed{ x=\left[ - \sqrt[4.00]{- \frac{1.00}{\epsilon}}, \  \sqrt[4.00]{- \frac{1.00}{\epsilon}}, \  - i \sqrt[4.00]{- \frac{1.00}{\epsilon}}, \  i \sqrt[4.00]{- \frac{1.00}{\epsilon}}\right].}\]

We have found 4.00 roots that are valid in the limit of small positive $\epsilon$ and 4.00 roots valid in the limit of large positive $\epsilon$. Our method therefore provides a complete solution to the problem, finding the correct number of roots in each $\epsilon$ regime.

"Consider the polynomial\[P(x) =\epsilon x^{10} - x^{5} + 1.\] 
Find first order approximations for all roots of the polynomial in the limit of small positive $\epsilon$ and large positive $\epsilon$. ","We begin by equating the polynomial to zero to solve for the roots: $P(x) = 0.00$ This problem can be rewritten in the form $A+B+C=0.00$, where: $A=\epsilon x^{10.00};$ $B=- x^{5.00};$ $C=1.00$

We find approximate solutions to the roots by considering the three possible dominant balances. For each dominant balance, we find the roots of the resulting equation and evaluate whether each balance is self-consistent for small or large positive $\epsilon$. \vspace{1.00em}

We start with the balance $A+B=0.00$, assuming that $|C|$ is negligible when compared to $|A|$ and $|B|$. Solving this for $x$ in terms of $\epsilon$ then gives us 5.00 non-zero roots: 
\[\epsilon x^{10.00} - x^{5.00}=0.00 \]\[ \implies \boxed{ x=\left[ \frac{\left(- \sqrt{5.00} - 1.00 - \sqrt{2.00} \sqrt{-5.00 + \sqrt{5.00}}\right) \sqrt[5.00]{\frac{1.00}{\epsilon}}}{4.00}, \  \frac{\left(- \sqrt{5.00} - 1.00 + \sqrt{2.00} \sqrt{-5.00 + \sqrt{5.00}}\right) \sqrt[5.00]{\frac{1.00}{\epsilon}}}{4.00}, \  \frac{\left(-1.00 + \sqrt{5.00} - \sqrt{2.00} \sqrt{-5.00 - \sqrt{5.00}}\right) \sqrt[5.00]{\frac{1.00}{\epsilon}}}{4.00}, \  \frac{\left(-1.00 + \sqrt{5.00} + \sqrt{2.00} \sqrt{-5.00 - \sqrt{5.00}}\right) \sqrt[5.00]{\frac{1.00}{\epsilon}}}{4.00}, \  \sqrt[5.00]{\frac{1.00}{\epsilon}}\right].}\]
To verify that these roots are consistent with the assumption that $|A|, |B| \gg |C|,$ we substitute these found roots back into the terms $A$, $B$, and $C$ and compare their magnitudes. Using this method, we find that it is true that these roots are valid for small $\epsilon$, while validity for large $\epsilon$ is false.

\underline{Therefore, these roots are valid in the limit of small positive $\epsilon$ only.}\vspace{1.00em}

Next we examine the balance $B+C=0.00$, assuming that $|A|$ is negligible when compared to $|B|$ and $|C|$. Solving this for $x$ in terms of $\epsilon$ gives us 5.00 non-zero roots: \[1.00 - x^{5.00}=0.00\]\[ \implies\boxed{ x=\left[ 1.00, \  - \frac{1.00}{4.00} + \frac{\sqrt{5.00}}{4.00} - \frac{i \sqrt{2.00 \sqrt{5.00} + 10.00}}{4.00}, \  - \frac{1.00}{4.00} + \frac{\sqrt{5.00}}{4.00} + \frac{\sqrt{-10.00 - 2.00 \sqrt{5.00}}}{4.00}, \  - \frac{\sqrt{5.00}}{4.00} - \frac{1.00}{4.00} - \frac{i \sqrt{10.00 - 2.00 \sqrt{5.00}}}{4.00}, \  - \frac{\sqrt{5.00}}{4.00} - \frac{1.00}{4.00} + \frac{i \sqrt{10.00 - 2.00 \sqrt{5.00}}}{4.00}\right].}\]

Finally, we examine the balance $A+C=0.00$, assuming that $|B|$ is negligible when compared to $|A|$ and $|C|$. Solving this for $x$ in terms of $\epsilon$ gives us 10.00 non-zero roots: \[\epsilon x^{10.00} + 1.00=0.00\]\[ \implies\boxed{ x=\left[ - \sqrt[10.00]{- \frac{1.00}{\epsilon}}, \  \sqrt[10.00]{- \frac{1.00}{\epsilon}}, \  \frac{\sqrt[10.00]{- \frac{1.00}{\epsilon}} \left(-1.00 + \sqrt{5.00} - \sqrt{2.00} \sqrt{-5.00 - \sqrt{5.00}}\right)}{4.00}, \  \frac{\sqrt[10.00]{- \frac{1.00}{\epsilon}} \left(-1.00 + \sqrt{5.00} + \sqrt{2.00} \sqrt{-5.00 - \sqrt{5.00}}\right)}{4.00}, \  \frac{\sqrt[10.00]{- \frac{1.00}{\epsilon}} \left(1.00 + \sqrt{5.00} - \sqrt{2.00} \sqrt{-5.00 + \sqrt{5.00}}\right)}{4.00}, \  \frac{\sqrt[10.00]{- \frac{1.00}{\epsilon}} \left(1.00 + \sqrt{5.00} + \sqrt{2.00} \sqrt{-5.00 + \sqrt{5.00}}\right)}{4.00}, \  \frac{\sqrt[10.00]{- \frac{1.00}{\epsilon}} \left(- \sqrt{5.00} - 1.00 - \sqrt{2.00} \sqrt{-5.00 + \sqrt{5.00}}\right)}{4.00}, \  \frac{\sqrt[10.00]{- \frac{1.00}{\epsilon}} \left(- \sqrt{5.00} - 1.00 + \sqrt{2.00} \sqrt{-5.00 + \sqrt{5.00}}\right)}{4.00}, \  \frac{\sqrt[10.00]{- \frac{1.00}{\epsilon}} \left(- \sqrt{5.00} + 1.00 - \sqrt{2.00} \sqrt{-5.00 - \sqrt{5.00}}\right)}{4.00}, \  \frac{\sqrt[10.00]{- \frac{1.00}{\epsilon}} \left(- \sqrt{5.00} + 1.00 + \sqrt{2.00} \sqrt{-5.00 - \sqrt{5.00}}\right)}{4.00}\right].}\]

By the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra, a polynomial of degree 10.00 has exactly 10.00 roots. We have found 10.00 roots that are valid in the limit of small positive $\epsilon$ and 10.00 roots valid in the limit of large positive $\epsilon$. Our method therefore provides a complete solution to the problem, finding the correct number of roots in each $\epsilon$ regime. 

The roots of $P(x)$ for large positive $\epsilon$ are\[ \boxed{ \left[ - \sqrt[10.00]{- \frac{1.00}{\epsilon}}, \  \sqrt[10.00]{- \frac{1.00}{\epsilon}}, \  \frac{\sqrt[10.00]{- \frac{1.00}{\epsilon}} \left(-1.00 + \sqrt{5.00} - \sqrt{2.00} \sqrt{-5.00 - \sqrt{5.00}}\right)}{4.00}, \  \frac{\sqrt[10.00]{- \frac{1.00}{\epsilon}} \left(-1.00 + \sqrt{5.00} + \sqrt{2.00} \sqrt{-5.00 - \sqrt{5.00}}\right)}{4.00}, \  \frac{\sqrt[10.00]{- \frac{1.00}{\epsilon}} \left(1.00 + \sqrt{5.00} - \sqrt{2.00} \sqrt{-5.00 + \sqrt{5.00}}\right)}{4.00}, \  \frac{\sqrt[10.00]{- \frac{1.00}{\epsilon}} \left(1.00 + \sqrt{5.00} + \sqrt{2.00} \sqrt{-5.00 + \sqrt{5.00}}\right)}{4.00}, \  \frac{\sqrt[10.00]{- \frac{1.00}{\epsilon}} \left(- \sqrt{5.00} - 1.00 - \sqrt{2.00} \sqrt{-5.00 + \sqrt{5.00}}\right)}{4.00}, \  \frac{\sqrt[10.00]{- \frac{1.00}{\epsilon}} \left(- \sqrt{5.00} - 1.00 + \sqrt{2.00} \sqrt{-5.00 + \sqrt{5.00}}\right)}{4.00}, \  \frac{\sqrt[10.00]{- \frac{1.00}{\epsilon}} \left(- \sqrt{5.00} + 1.00 - \sqrt{2.00} \sqrt{-5.00 - \sqrt{5.00}}\right)}{4.00}, \  \frac{\sqrt[10.00]{- \frac{1.00}{\epsilon}} \left(- \sqrt{5.00} + 1.00 + \sqrt{2.00} \sqrt{-5.00 - \sqrt{5.00}}\right)}{4.00}\right]} \]and the roots of $P(x)$ for small positive $\epsilon$ are\[ \boxed{ \left[ \frac{\left(- \sqrt{5.00} - 1.00 - \sqrt{2.00} \sqrt{-5.00 + \sqrt{5.00}}\right) \sqrt[5.00]{\frac{1.00}{\epsilon}}}{4.00}, \  \frac{\left(- \sqrt{5.00} - 1.00 + \sqrt{2.00} \sqrt{-5.00 + \sqrt{5.00}}\right) \sqrt[5.00]{\frac{1.00}{\epsilon}}}{4.00}, \  \frac{\left(-1.00 + \sqrt{5.00} - \sqrt{2.00} \sqrt{-5.00 - \sqrt{5.00}}\right) \sqrt[5.00]{\frac{1.00}{\epsilon}}}{4.00}, \  \frac{\left(-1.00 + \sqrt{5.00} + \sqrt{2.00} \sqrt{-5.00 - \sqrt{5.00}}\right) \sqrt[5.00]{\frac{1.00}{\epsilon}}}{4.00}, \  \sqrt[5.00]{\frac{1.00}{\epsilon}}, \  1.00, \  - \frac{1.00}{4.00} + \frac{\sqrt{5.00}}{4.00} - \frac{i \sqrt{2.00 \sqrt{5.00} + 10.00}}{4.00}, \  - \frac{1.00}{4.00} + \frac{\sqrt{5.00}}{4.00} + \frac{\sqrt{-10.00 - 2.00 \sqrt{5.00}}}{4.00}, \  - \frac{\sqrt{5.00}}{4.00} - \frac{1.00}{4.00} - \frac{i \sqrt{10.00 - 2.00 \sqrt{5.00}}}{4.00}, \  - \frac{\sqrt{5.00}}{4.00} - \frac{1.00}{4.00} + \frac{i \sqrt{10.00 - 2.00 \sqrt{5.00}}}{4.00}\right]} \]",polynomial_roots,list,0.01,"[[(-2.032158811031093-1.4764497998748987j), (-2.032158811031093+1.4764497998748987j), (0.7762155952763027-2.388945958880566j), (0.7762155952763027+2.388945958880566j), (2.51188643150958+0j), (1+0j), (0.30901699437494745-0.9510565162951535j), (0.30901699437494745+0.9510565162951535j), (-0.8090169943749475-0.5877852522924731j), (-0.8090169943749475+0.5877852522924731j)]]","[-2.02803632+1.47345464j -2.02803632-1.47345464j  0.77464095+2.38409969j

"Consider the polynomial\[P(x) =\epsilon x^{5} + x^{3} - 1.\] 
Find first order approximations for all roots of the polynomial in the limit of small positive $\epsilon$ and large positive $\epsilon$. ","We begin by equating the polynomial to zero to solve for the roots: $P(x) = 0.00$ This problem can be rewritten in the form $A+B+C=0.00$, where: $A=\epsilon x^{5.00};$ $B=x^{3.00};$ $C=-1.00$

We find approximate solutions to the roots by considering the three possible dominant balances. For each dominant balance, we find the roots of the resulting equation and evaluate whether each balance is self-consistent for small or large positive $\epsilon$. \vspace{1.00em}

We start with the balance $A+B=0.00$, assuming that $|C|$ is negligible when compared to $|A|$ and $|B|$. Solving this for $x$ in terms of $\epsilon$ then gives us 2.00 non-zero roots: 
\[\epsilon x^{5.00} + x^{3.00}=0.00 \]\[ \implies \boxed{ x=\left[ - \sqrt{- \frac{1.00}{\epsilon}}, \  \sqrt{- \frac{1.00}{\epsilon}}\right].}\]
To verify that these roots are consistent with the assumption that $|A|, |B| \gg |C|,$ we substitute these found roots back into the terms $A$, $B$, and $C$ and compare their magnitudes. Using this method, we find that it is true that these roots are valid for small $\epsilon$, while validity for large $\epsilon$ is false.

"Consider the polynomial\[P(x) =\epsilon x^{9} - x^{3} + 1.\] 
Find first order approximations for all roots of the polynomial in the limit of small positive $\epsilon$ and large positive $\epsilon$. ","We begin by equating the polynomial to zero to solve for the roots: $P(x) = 0.00$ This problem can be rewritten in the form $A+B+C=0.00$, where: $A=\epsilon x^{9.00};$ $B=- x^{3.00};$ $C=1.00$

We find approximate solutions to the roots by considering the three possible dominant balances. For each dominant balance, we find the roots of the resulting equation and evaluate whether each balance is self-consistent for small or large positive $\epsilon$. \vspace{1.00em}

We start with the balance $A+B=0.00$, assuming that $|C|$ is negligible when compared to $|A|$ and $|B|$. Solving this for $x$ in terms of $\epsilon$ then gives us 6.00 non-zero roots: 
\[\epsilon x^{9.00} - x^{3.00}=0.00 \]\[ \implies \boxed{ x=\left[ \frac{\left(-1.00 - \sqrt{3.00} i\right) \sqrt[6.00]{\frac{1.00}{\epsilon}}}{2.00}, \  \frac{\left(-1.00 + \sqrt{3.00} i\right) \sqrt[6.00]{\frac{1.00}{\epsilon}}}{2.00}, \  \frac{\left(1.00 - \sqrt{3.00} i\right) \sqrt[6.00]{\frac{1.00}{\epsilon}}}{2.00}, \  \frac{\left(1.00 + \sqrt{3.00} i\right) \sqrt[6.00]{\frac{1.00}{\epsilon}}}{2.00}, \  - \sqrt[6.00]{\frac{1.00}{\epsilon}}, \  \sqrt[6.00]{\frac{1.00}{\epsilon}}\right].}\]
To verify that these roots are consistent with the assumption that $|A|, |B| \gg |C|,$ we substitute these found roots back into the terms $A$, $B$, and $C$ and compare their magnitudes. Using this method, we find that it is true that these roots are valid for small $\epsilon$, while validity for large $\epsilon$ is false.

\underline{Therefore, these roots are valid in the limit of small positive $\epsilon$ only.}\vspace{1.00em}

Next we examine the balance $B+C=0.00$, assuming that $|A|$ is negligible when compared to $|B|$ and $|C|$. Solving this for $x$ in terms of $\epsilon$ gives us 3.00 non-zero roots: \[1.00 - x^{3.00}=0.00\]\[ \implies\boxed{ x=\left[ 1.00, \  - \frac{1.00}{2.00} - \frac{\sqrt{3.00} i}{2.00}, \  - \frac{1.00}{2.00} + \frac{\sqrt{3.00} i}{2.00}\right].}\]

Find first order approximations for all roots of the polynomial in the limit of small positive $\epsilon$ and large positive $\epsilon$.

\[\epsilon x^{9.00} - x^{2.00}=0.00 \]\[ \implies \boxed{ x=\left[ - \sqrt[7.00]{\frac{1.00}{\epsilon}} e^{\frac{i \pi}{7.00}}, \  - \sqrt[7.00]{\frac{1.00}{\epsilon}} e^{- \frac{i \pi}{7.00}}, \  \sqrt[7.00]{\frac{1.00}{\epsilon}} e^{- \frac{2.00 i \pi}{7.00}}, \  \sqrt[7.00]{\frac{1.00}{\epsilon}} e^{\frac{2.00 i \pi}{7.00}}, \  - \left(\sin{\left(\frac{\pi}{14.00} \right)} + i \cos{\left(\frac{\pi}{14.00} \right)}\right) \sqrt[7.00]{\frac{1.00}{\epsilon}}, \  \left(- \sin{\left(\frac{\pi}{14.00} \right)} + i \cos{\left(\frac{\pi}{14.00} \right)}\right) \sqrt[7.00]{\frac{1.00}{\epsilon}}, \  \sqrt[7.00]{\frac{1.00}{\epsilon}}\right].}\]
To verify that these roots are consistent with the assumption that $|A|, |B| \gg |C|,$ we substitute these found roots back into the terms $A$, $B$, and $C$ and compare their magnitudes. Using this method, we find that it is true that these roots are valid for small $\epsilon$, while validity for large $\epsilon$ is false.

\underline{Therefore, these roots are valid in the limit of small positive $\epsilon$ only.}\vspace{1.00em}

Next we examine the balance $B+C=0.00$, assuming that $|A|$ is negligible when compared to $|B|$ and $|C|$. Solving this for $x$ in terms of $\epsilon$ gives us 2.00 non-zero roots: \[- x^{2.00} - 1.00=0.00\]\[ \implies\boxed{ x=\left[ - i, \  i\right].}\]

Finally, we examine the balance $A+C=0.00$, assuming that $|B|$ is negligible when compared to $|A|$ and $|C|$. Solving this for $x$ in terms of $\epsilon$ gives us 9.00 non-zero roots: \[\epsilon x^{9.00} - 1.00=0.00\]\[ \implies\boxed{ x=\left[ - \sqrt[9.00]{\frac{1.00}{\epsilon}} e^{\frac{i \pi}{9.00}}, \  - \sqrt[9.00]{\frac{1.00}{\epsilon}} e^{- \frac{i \pi}{9.00}}, \  \sqrt[9.00]{\frac{1.00}{\epsilon}} e^{- \frac{2.00 i \pi}{9.00}}, \  \sqrt[9.00]{\frac{1.00}{\epsilon}} e^{\frac{2.00 i \pi}{9.00}}, \  \left(\sin{\left(\frac{\pi}{18.00} \right)} - i \cos{\left(\frac{\pi}{18.00} \right)}\right) \sqrt[9.00]{\frac{1.00}{\epsilon}}, \  \left(\sin{\left(\frac{\pi}{18.00} \right)} + i \cos{\left(\frac{\pi}{18.00} \right)}\right) \sqrt[9.00]{\frac{1.00}{\epsilon}}, \  \frac{\left(-1.00 - \sqrt{3.00} i\right) \sqrt[9.00]{\frac{1.00}{\epsilon}}}{2.00}, \  \frac{\left(-1.00 + \sqrt{3.00} i\right) \sqrt[9.00]{\frac{1.00}{\epsilon}}}{2.00}, \  \sqrt[9.00]{\frac{1.00}{\epsilon}}\right].}\]

"Consider the polynomial\[P(x) =\epsilon x^{4} - x^{2} - 1.\] 
Find first order approximations for all roots of the polynomial in the limit of small positive $\epsilon$ and large positive $\epsilon$. ","We begin by equating the polynomial to zero to solve for the roots: $P(x) = 0.00$ This problem can be rewritten in the form $A+B+C=0.00$, where: $A=\epsilon x^{4.00};$ $B=- x^{2.00};$ $C=-1.00$

We find approximate solutions to the roots by considering the three possible dominant balances. For each dominant balance, we find the roots of the resulting equation and evaluate whether each balance is self-consistent for small or large positive $\epsilon$. \vspace{1.00em}

We start with the balance $A+B=0.00$, assuming that $|C|$ is negligible when compared to $|A|$ and $|B|$. Solving this for $x$ in terms of $\epsilon$ then gives us 2.00 non-zero roots: 
\[\epsilon x^{4.00} - x^{2.00}=0.00 \]\[ \implies \boxed{ x=\left[ - \sqrt{\frac{1.00}{\epsilon}}, \  \sqrt{\frac{1.00}{\epsilon}}\right].}\]
To verify that these roots are consistent with the assumption that $|A|, |B| \gg |C|,$ we substitute these found roots back into the terms $A$, $B$, and $C$ and compare their magnitudes.

To verify that these roots are consistent with the assumption that $|B|, |C| \gg |A|,$ we substitute these found roots back into $A$, $B$, and $C$ and compare their magnitudes.

"Consider the polynomial\[P(x) =\epsilon x^{8} - x^{3} - 1.\] 
Find first order approximations for all roots of the polynomial in the limit of small positive $\epsilon$ and large positive $\epsilon$. ","We begin by equating the polynomial to zero to solve for the roots: $P(x) = 0.00$ This problem can be rewritten in the form $A+B+C=0.00$, where: $A=\epsilon x^{8.00};$ $B=- x^{3.00};$ $C=-1.00$

We find approximate solutions to the roots by considering the three possible dominant balances. For each dominant balance, we find the roots of the resulting equation and evaluate whether each balance is self-consistent for small or large positive $\epsilon$. \vspace{1.00em}

We start with the balance $A+B=0.00$, assuming that $|C|$ is negligible when compared to $|A|$ and $|B|$. Solving this for $x$ in terms of $\epsilon$ then gives us 5.00 non-zero roots: 
\[\epsilon x^{8.00} - x^{3.00}=0.00 \]\[ \implies \boxed{ x=\left[ \frac{\left(- \sqrt{5.00} - 1.00 - \sqrt{2.00} \sqrt{-5.00 + \sqrt{5.00}}\right) \sqrt[5.00]{\frac{1.00}{\epsilon}}}{4.00}, \  \frac{\left(- \sqrt{5.00} - 1.00 + \sqrt{2.00} \sqrt{-5.00 + \sqrt{5.00}}\right) \sqrt[5.00]{\frac{1.00}{\epsilon}}}{4.00}, \  \frac{\left(-1.00 + \sqrt{5.00} - \sqrt{2.00} \sqrt{-5.00 - \sqrt{5.00}}\right) \sqrt[5.00]{\frac{1.00}{\epsilon}}}{4.00}, \  \frac{\left(-1.00 + \sqrt{5.00} + \sqrt{2.00} \sqrt{-5.00 - \sqrt{5.00}}\right) \sqrt[5.00]{\frac{1.00}{\epsilon}}}{4.00}, \  \sqrt[5.00]{\frac{1.00}{\epsilon}}\right].}\]
To verify that these roots are consistent with the assumption that $|A|, |B| \gg |C|,$ we substitute these found roots back into the terms $A$, $B$, and $C$ and compare their magnitudes. Using this method, we find that it is true that these roots are valid for small $\epsilon$, while validity for large $\epsilon$ is false.

\underline{Therefore, these roots are valid in the limit of small positive $\epsilon$ only.}\vspace{1.00em}

Next we examine the balance $B+C=0.00$, assuming that $|A|$ is negligible when compared to $|B|$ and $|C|$. Solving this for $x$ in terms of $\epsilon$ gives us 3.00 non-zero roots: \[- x^{3.00} - 1.00=0.00\]\[ \implies\boxed{ x=\left[ -1.00, \  \frac{1.00}{2.00} - \frac{\sqrt{3.00} i}{2.00}, \  \frac{1.00}{2.00} + \frac{\sqrt{3.00} i}{2.00}\right].}\]

Finally, we examine the balance $A+C=0.00$, assuming that $|B|$ is negligible when compared to $|A|$ and $|C|$. Solving this for $x$ in terms of $\epsilon$ gives us 8.00 non-zero roots: \[\epsilon x^{8.00} - 1.00=0.00\]\[ \implies\boxed{ x=\left[ - i \sqrt[8.00]{\frac{1.00}{\epsilon}}, \  i \sqrt[8.00]{\frac{1.00}{\epsilon}}, \  \frac{\sqrt{2.00} \left(-1.00 - i\right) \sqrt[8.00]{\frac{1.00}{\epsilon}}}{2.00}, \  \frac{\sqrt{2.00} \left(-1.00 + i\right) \sqrt[8.00]{\frac{1.00}{\epsilon}}}{2.00}, \  \frac{\sqrt{2.00} \cdot \left(1.00 - i\right) \sqrt[8.00]{\frac{1.00}{\epsilon}}}{2.00}, \  \frac{\sqrt{2.00} \cdot \left(1.00 + i\right) \sqrt[8.00]{\frac{1.00}{\epsilon}}}{2.00}, \  - \sqrt[8.00]{\frac{1.00}{\epsilon}}, \  \sqrt[8.00]{\frac{1.00}{\epsilon}}\right].}\]
To verify that these roots are consistent with the assumption that $|A|, |C| \gg |B|,$ we substitute these found roots back into $A$, $B$, and $C$ and compare their magnitudes.

By the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra, a polynomial of degree 8.00 has exactly 8.00 roots. We have found 8.00 roots that are valid in the limit of small positive $\epsilon$ and 8.00 roots valid in the limit of large positive $\epsilon$. Our method therefore provides a complete solution to the problem, finding the correct number of roots in each $\epsilon$ regime. 

The roots of $P(x)$ for large positive $\epsilon$ are\[ \boxed{ \left[ - i \sqrt[8.00]{\frac{1.00}{\epsilon}}, \  i \sqrt[8.00]{\frac{1.00}{\epsilon}}, \  \frac{\sqrt{2.00} \left(-1.00 - i\right) \sqrt[8.00]{\frac{1.00}{\epsilon}}}{2.00}, \  \frac{\sqrt{2.00} \left(-1.00 + i\right) \sqrt[8.00]{\frac{1.00}{\epsilon}}}{2.00}, \  \frac{\sqrt{2.00} \cdot \left(1.00 - i\right) \sqrt[8.00]{\frac{1.00}{\epsilon}}}{2.00}, \  \frac{\sqrt{2.00} \cdot \left(1.00 + i\right) \sqrt[8.00]{\frac{1.00}{\epsilon}}}{2.00}, \  - \sqrt[8.00]{\frac{1.00}{\epsilon}}, \  \sqrt[8.00]{\frac{1.00}{\epsilon}}\right]} \]and the roots of $P(x)$ for small positive $\epsilon$ are\[ \boxed{ \left[ \frac{\left(- \sqrt{5.00} - 1.00 - \sqrt{2.00} \sqrt{-5.00 + \sqrt{5.00}}\right) \sqrt[5.00]{\frac{1.00}{\epsilon}}}{4.00}, \  \frac{\left(- \sqrt{5.00} - 1.00 + \sqrt{2.00} \sqrt{-5.00 + \sqrt{5.00}}\right) \sqrt[5.00]{\frac{1.00}{\epsilon}}}{4.00}, \  \frac{\left(-1.00 + \sqrt{5.00} - \sqrt{2.00} \sqrt{-5.00 - \sqrt{5.00}}\right) \sqrt[5.00]{\frac{1.00}{\epsilon}}}{4.00}, \  \frac{\left(-1.00 + \sqrt{5.00} + \sqrt{2.00} \sqrt{-5.00 - \sqrt{5.00}}\right) \sqrt[5.00]{\frac{1.00}{\epsilon}}}{4.00}, \  \sqrt[5.00]{\frac{1.00}{\epsilon}}, \  -1.00, \  \frac{1.00}{2.00} - \frac{\sqrt{3.00} i}{2.00}, \  \frac{1.00}{2.00} + \frac{\sqrt{3.00} i}{2.00}\right]} \]",polynomial_roots,list,0.01,"[[(-2.032158811031093-1.4764497998748987j), (-2.032158811031093+1.4764497998748987j), (0.7762155952763027-2.388945958880566j), (0.7762155952763027+2.388945958880566j), (2.51188643150958+0j), (-1+0j), (0.5-0.8660254037844386j), (0.5+0.8660254037844386j)]]","[ 2.54176062+0.j          0.74840639+2.37045529j  0.74840639-2.37045529j

Find first order approximations for all roots of the polynomial in the limit of small positive $\epsilon$ and large positive $\epsilon$.

","We begin by equating the polynomial to zero to solve for the roots: $P(x) = 0.00$ This problem can be rewritten in the form $A+B+C=0.00$, where: $A=\epsilon x^{6.00};$ $B=- x^{5.00};$ $C=-1.00$

We find approximate solutions to the roots by considering the three possible dominant balances. For each dominant balance, we find the roots of the resulting equation and evaluate whether each balance is self-consistent for small or large positive $\epsilon$. \vspace{1.00em}

We start with the balance $A+B=0.00$, assuming that $|C|$ is negligible when compared to $|A|$ and $|B|$. Solving this for $x$ in terms of $\epsilon$ then gives us 1.00 non-zero root: 
\[\epsilon x^{6.00} - x^{5.00}=0.00 \]\[ \implies \boxed{ x=\left[ \frac{1.00}{\epsilon}\right].}\]
To verify that these roots are consistent with the assumption that $|A|, |B| \gg |C|,$ we substitute these found roots back into the terms $A$, $B$, and $C$ and compare their magnitudes. Using this method, we find that it is true that these roots are valid for small $\epsilon$, while validity for large $\epsilon$ is false.

\underline{Therefore, these roots are valid in the limit of small positive $\epsilon$ only.}\vspace{1.00em}

Next we examine the balance $B+C=0.00$, assuming that $|A|$ is negligible when compared to $|B|$ and $|C|$. Solving this for $x$ in terms of $\epsilon$ gives us 5.00 non-zero roots: \[- x^{5.00} - 1.00=0.00\]\[ \implies\boxed{ x=\left[ -1.00, \  \frac{1.00}{4.00} + \frac{\sqrt{5.00}}{4.00} + \frac{\sqrt{-10.00 + 2.00 \sqrt{5.00}}}{4.00}, \  - \frac{\sqrt{5.00}}{4.00} + \frac{1.00}{4.00} - \frac{i \sqrt{50.00 - 10.00 \sqrt{5.00}}}{8.00} - \frac{i \sqrt{10.00 - 2.00 \sqrt{5.00}}}{8.00}, \  \frac{1.00}{4.00} + \frac{\sqrt{5.00}}{4.00} - \frac{i \sqrt{10.00 \sqrt{5.00} + 50.00}}{16.00} - \frac{i \sqrt{2.00 \sqrt{5.00} + 10.00}}{16.00} - \frac{i \sqrt{10.00 - 2.00 \sqrt{5.00}}}{16.00} + \frac{i \sqrt{50.00 - 10.00 \sqrt{5.00}}}{16.00}, \  - \frac{\sqrt{5.00}}{4.00} + \frac{1.00}{4.00} - \frac{\sqrt{-10.00 + 2.00 \sqrt{5.00}}}{16.00} + \frac{\sqrt{-10.00 - 2.00 \sqrt{5.00}}}{16.00} + \frac{\sqrt{-50.00 + 10.00 \sqrt{5.00}}}{16.00} + \frac{\sqrt{-50.00 - 10.00 \sqrt{5.00}}}{16.00}\right].}\]
To verify that these roots are consistent with the assumption that $|B|, |C| \gg |A|,$ we substitute these found roots back into $A$, $B$, and $C$ and compare their magnitudes. Using this method, we find that it is true that these roots are valid for small $\epsilon$, while validity for large $\epsilon$ is false.

\underline{Therefore, these roots are valid in the limit of small positive $\epsilon$ only.}\vspace{1.00em}

Finally, we examine the balance $A+C=0.00$, assuming that $|B|$ is negligible when compared to $|A|$ and $|C|$. Solving this for $x$ in terms of $\epsilon$ gives us 6.00 non-zero roots: \[\epsilon x^{6.00} - 1.00=0.00\]\[ \implies\boxed{ x=\left[ \frac{\left(-1.00 - \sqrt{3.00} i\right) \sqrt[6.00]{\frac{1.00}{\epsilon}}}{2.00}, \  \frac{\left(-1.00 + \sqrt{3.00} i\right) \sqrt[6.00]{\frac{1.00}{\epsilon}}}{2.00}, \  \frac{\left(1.00 - \sqrt{3.00} i\right) \sqrt[6.00]{\frac{1.00}{\epsilon}}}{2.00}, \  \frac{\left(1.00 + \sqrt{3.00} i\right) \sqrt[6.00]{\frac{1.00}{\epsilon}}}{2.00}, \  - \sqrt[6.00]{\frac{1.00}{\epsilon}}, \  \sqrt[6.00]{\frac{1.00}{\epsilon}}\right].}\]
To verify that these roots are consistent with the assumption that $|A|, |C| \gg |B|,$ we substitute these found roots back into $A$, $B$, and $C$ and compare their magnitudes. Using this method, we find that it is false that these roots are valid for small $\epsilon$, while validity for large $\epsilon$ is true.

By the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra, a polynomial of degree 6.00 has exactly 6.00 roots. We have found 6.00 roots that are valid in the limit of small positive $\epsilon$ and 6.00 roots valid in the limit of large positive $\epsilon$. Our method therefore provides a complete solution to the problem, finding the correct number of roots in each $\epsilon$ regime. 

The roots of $P(x)$ for large positive $\epsilon$ are\[ \boxed{ \left[ \frac{\left(-1.00 - \sqrt{3.00} i\right) \sqrt[6.00]{\frac{1.00}{\epsilon}}}{2.00}, \  \frac{\left(-1.00 + \sqrt{3.00} i\right) \sqrt[6.00]{\frac{1.00}{\epsilon}}}{2.00}, \  \frac{\left(1.00 - \sqrt{3.00} i\right) \sqrt[6.00]{\frac{1.00}{\epsilon}}}{2.00}, \  \frac{\left(1.00 + \sqrt{3.00} i\right) \sqrt[6.00]{\frac{1.00}{\epsilon}}}{2.00}, \  - \sqrt[6.00]{\frac{1.00}{\epsilon}}, \  \sqrt[6.00]{\frac{1.00}{\epsilon}}\right]} \]and the roots of $P(x)$ for small positive $\epsilon$ are\[ \boxed{ \left[ \frac{1.00}{\epsilon}, \  -1.00, \  \frac{1.00}{4.00} + \frac{\sqrt{5.00}}{4.00} + \frac{\sqrt{-10.00 + 2.00 \sqrt{5.00}}}{4.00}, \  - \frac{\sqrt{5.00}}{4.00} + \frac{1.00}{4.00} - \frac{i \sqrt{50.00 - 10.00 \sqrt{5.00}}}{8.00} - \frac{i \sqrt{10.00 - 2.00 \sqrt{5.00}}}{8.00}, \  \frac{1.00}{4.00} + \frac{\sqrt{5.00}}{4.00} - \frac{i \sqrt{10.00 \sqrt{5.00} + 50.00}}{16.00} - \frac{i \sqrt{2.00 \sqrt{5.00} + 10.00}}{16.00} - \frac{i \sqrt{10.00 - 2.00 \sqrt{5.00}}}{16.00} + \frac{i \sqrt{50.00 - 10.00 \sqrt{5.00}}}{16.00}, \  - \frac{\sqrt{5.00}}{4.00} + \frac{1.00}{4.00} - \frac{\sqrt{-10.00 + 2.00 \sqrt{5.00}}}{16.00} + \frac{\sqrt{-10.00 - 2.00 \sqrt{5.00}}}{16.00} + \frac{\sqrt{-50.00 + 10.00 \sqrt{5.00}}}{16.00} + \frac{\sqrt{-50.00 - 10.00 \sqrt{5.00}}}{16.00}\right]} \]",polynomial_roots,list,0.01,"[[(100+0j), (-1+0j), (0.8090169943749475+0.5877852522924731j), (-0.30901699437494745-0.9510565162951535j), (0.8090169943749475-0.5877852522924731j), (-0.30901699437494745+0.9510565162951535j)]]","[100.00000001+0.j           0.80962995+0.58970268j

"Consider the polynomial\[P(x) =\epsilon x^{9} - x^{5} - 1.\] 
Find first order approximations for all roots of the polynomial in the limit of small positive $\epsilon$ and large positive $\epsilon$. ","We begin by equating the polynomial to zero to solve for the roots: $P(x) = 0.00$ This problem can be rewritten in the form $A+B+C=0.00$, where: $A=\epsilon x^{9.00};$ $B=- x^{5.00};$ $C=-1.00$

We find approximate solutions to the roots by considering the three possible dominant balances. For each dominant balance, we find the roots of the resulting equation and evaluate whether each balance is self-consistent for small or large positive $\epsilon$. \vspace{1.00em}

We start with the balance $A+B=0.00$, assuming that $|C|$ is negligible when compared to $|A|$ and $|B|$. Solving this for $x$ in terms of $\epsilon$ then gives us 4.00 non-zero roots: 
\[\epsilon x^{9.00} - x^{5.00}=0.00 \]\[ \implies \boxed{ x=\left[ - i \sqrt[4.00]{\frac{1.00}{\epsilon}}, \  i \sqrt[4.00]{\frac{1.00}{\epsilon}}, \  - \sqrt[4.00]{\frac{1.00}{\epsilon}}, \  \sqrt[4.00]{\frac{1.00}{\epsilon}}\right].}\]

","We begin by equating the polynomial to zero to solve for the roots: $P(x) = 0.00$ This problem can be rewritten in the form $A+B+C=0.00$, where: $A=\epsilon x^{5.00};$ $B=- x^{2.00};$ $C=1.00$

We find approximate solutions to the roots by considering the three possible dominant balances. For each dominant balance, we find the roots of the resulting equation and evaluate whether each balance is self-consistent for small or large positive $\epsilon$. \vspace{1.00em}

We start with the balance $A+B=0.00$, assuming that $|C|$ is negligible when compared to $|A|$ and $|B|$. Solving this for $x$ in terms of $\epsilon$ then gives us 3.00 non-zero roots: 
\[\epsilon x^{5.00} - x^{2.00}=0.00 \]\[ \implies \boxed{ x=\left[ \frac{\left(-1.00 - \sqrt{3.00} i\right) \sqrt[3.00]{\frac{1.00}{\epsilon}}}{2.00}, \  \frac{\left(-1.00 + \sqrt{3.00} i\right) \sqrt[3.00]{\frac{1.00}{\epsilon}}}{2.00}, \  \sqrt[3.00]{\frac{1.00}{\epsilon}}\right].}\]
To verify that these roots are consistent with the assumption that $|A|, |B| \gg |C|,$ we substitute these found roots back into the terms $A$, $B$, and $C$ and compare their magnitudes. Using this method, we find that it is true that these roots are valid for small $\epsilon$, while validity for large $\epsilon$ is false.

\underline{Therefore, these roots are valid in the limit of small positive $\epsilon$ only.}\vspace{1.00em}

Next we examine the balance $B+C=0.00$, assuming that $|A|$ is negligible when compared to $|B|$ and $|C|$. Solving this for $x$ in terms of $\epsilon$ gives us 2.00 non-zero roots: \[1.00 - x^{2.00}=0.00\]\[ \implies\boxed{ x=\left[ -1.00, \  1.00\right].}\]

Finally, we examine the balance $A+C=0.00$, assuming that $|B|$ is negligible when compared to $|A|$ and $|C|$. Solving this for $x$ in terms of $\epsilon$ gives us 5.00 non-zero roots: \[\epsilon x^{5.00} + 1.00=0.00\]\[ \implies\boxed{ x=\left[ \sqrt[5.00]{- \frac{1.00}{\epsilon}}, \  \frac{\sqrt[5.00]{- \frac{1.00}{\epsilon}} \left(-1.00 + \sqrt{5.00} - \sqrt{2.00} \sqrt{-5.00 - \sqrt{5.00}}\right)}{4.00}, \  \frac{\sqrt[5.00]{- \frac{1.00}{\epsilon}} \left(-1.00 + \sqrt{5.00} + \sqrt{2.00} \sqrt{-5.00 - \sqrt{5.00}}\right)}{4.00}, \  \frac{\sqrt[5.00]{- \frac{1.00}{\epsilon}} \left(- \sqrt{5.00} - 1.00 - \sqrt{2.00} \sqrt{-5.00 + \sqrt{5.00}}\right)}{4.00}, \  \frac{\sqrt[5.00]{- \frac{1.00}{\epsilon}} \left(- \sqrt{5.00} - 1.00 + \sqrt{2.00} \sqrt{-5.00 + \sqrt{5.00}}\right)}{4.00}\right].}\]
To verify that these roots are consistent with the assumption that $|A|, |C| \gg |B|,$ we substitute these found roots back into $A$, $B$, and $C$ and compare their magnitudes.

"Consider the following third-order ordinary differential equation $$y''' = - 2 x + \frac{y}{2} + y'^{4} + \frac{y''}{\sin{\left(x \right)} + 4} - 2$$
with initial conditions at $x = 0: y(0) = 0.00, y'(0) = 3.00, y''(0) = 3.00.$
Find analytical expressions that approximate the solution of $y(x)$ in the small and large $x$ regimes.

","
The solution in the small $x$ regime can be approximated using a Taylor series up to the third order. Plugging in the provided initial conditions, the Taylor series is:
$$y = x^{3} \cdot \left(\frac{79}{6} + \frac{1}{2 \left(\sin{\left(x \right)} + 4\right)}\right) + 1.5 x^{2} + 3 x.$$ 

To find the solution in the large $x$ regime, the method of dominant balance can be used. The dominant balance is given by $$\frac{d^{3}}{d x^{3}} y = \left(\frac{d}{d x} y\right)^{4}.$$

A power law ansatz can be used to approximate the solution at the divergence point. The ansatz has the form 
$$y = \alpha (x^* - x)^p,$$ 
where $x^*$ is the divergence point and can be determined through numerical code. Plugging in the ansatz and solving for the terms yields 
$$- \alpha p \left(0.241021602160216 - x\right)^{p - 3} \left(p - 2\right) \left(p - 1\right) = \alpha^{4} p^{4} \left(0.241021602160216 - x\right)^{4 p - 4}$$

After substituting the derivatives, the equation is reorganized to collect terms with respect to $(x^* - x)$. This leads to an equation where the coefficients and powers of $(x^* - x)$ are equated on both sides. Simplifying the equation gives us two separate equations, one for the coefficients and another for the powers of $(x^* - x)$.

The coefficients' equation is:
$$- \alpha p \left(p - 2\right) \left(p - 1\right) = \alpha^{4} p^{4}.$$

The powers' equation is:
$$p - 3 = 4 p - 4.$$

Solving this system of equations provides the values of $\alpha$ and $p$. 
A valid solution is identified if $\alpha$ and $p$ are both nonzero. 
In this case, the solution for $\alpha$ and $p$ is found to be:
$$\alpha = - \sqrt[3]{30}, \quad p = \frac{1}{3}.$$

The ansatz is now $$y' = - \sqrt[3]{30}(0.241021602160216-x)^{\frac{1}{3}},$$ but to account for the initial conditions, a constant, $c=a-y'(0)$, is calculated and added to the ansatz.
Thus, an analytical solution that approximates the solution at large $x$ is given by
$$y = - \sqrt[3]{30}(0.241021602160216-x)^{\frac{1}{3}} + 1.93.$$

Find analytical expressions that approximate the solution of $y(x)$ in the small and large $x$ regimes.

The solution in the small $x$ regime can be approximated using a Taylor series up to the third order. Plugging in the provided initial conditions, the Taylor series is:
$$y = x^{3} \cdot \left(\frac{1}{6} + \frac{1}{3 \left(\cos{\left(x \right)} + 2\right)}\right) + 1.0 x^{2} + x.$$ 

To find the solution in the large $x$ regime, the method of dominant balance can be used. The dominant balance is given by $$\frac{d^{3}}{d x^{3}} y = \left(\frac{d}{d x} y\right)^{5}.$$

A power law ansatz can be used to approximate the solution at the divergence point. The ansatz has the form 
$$y = \alpha (x^* - x)^p,$$ 
where $x^*$ is the divergence point and can be determined through numerical code. Plugging in the ansatz and solving for the terms yields 
$$- \alpha p \left(0.551049504950495 - x\right)^{p - 3} \left(p - 2\right) \left(p - 1\right) = - \alpha^{5} p^{5} \left(0.551049504950495 - x\right)^{5 p - 5}$$

After substituting the derivatives, the equation is reorganized to collect terms with respect to $(x^* - x)$. This leads to an equation where the coefficients and powers of $(x^* - x)$ are equated on both sides. Simplifying the equation gives us two separate equations, one for the coefficients and another for the powers of $(x^* - x)$.

The coefficients' equation is:
$$- \alpha p \left(p - 2\right) \left(p - 1\right) = - \alpha^{5} p^{5}.$$

The powers' equation is:
$$p - 3 = 5 p - 5.$$

Solving this system of equations provides the values of $\alpha$ and $p$. 
A valid solution is identified if $\alpha$ and $p$ are both nonzero. 
In this case, the solution for $\alpha$ and $p$ is found to be:
$$\alpha = - \sqrt{2} \cdot \sqrt[4]{3}, \quad p = \frac{1}{2}.$$

The ansatz is now $$y' = - \sqrt{2} \cdot \sqrt[4]{3}(0.551049504950495-x)^{\frac{1}{2}},$$ but to account for the initial conditions, a constant, $c=a-y'(0)$, is calculated and added to the ansatz.

The solution in the small $x$ regime can be approximated using a Taylor series up to the third order. Plugging in the provided initial conditions, the Taylor series is:
$$y = x^{3} \cdot \left(\frac{11}{2} + \frac{1}{3 \left(\tan{\left(x \right)} + 3\right)}\right) + 0.5 x^{2} + 2 x + 2.$$ 

To find the solution in the large $x$ regime, the method of dominant balance can be used. The dominant balance is given by $$\frac{d^{3}}{d x^{3}} y = \left(\frac{d}{d x} y\right)^{5}.$$

A power law ansatz can be used to approximate the solution at the divergence point. The ansatz has the form 
$$y = \alpha (x^* - x)^p,$$ 
where $x^*$ is the divergence point and can be determined through numerical code. Plugging in the ansatz and solving for the terms yields 
$$- \alpha p \left(0.261023402340234 - x\right)^{p - 3} \left(p - 2\right) \left(p - 1\right) = - \alpha^{5} p^{5} \left(0.261023402340234 - x\right)^{5 p - 5}$$

After substituting the derivatives, the equation is reorganized to collect terms with respect to $(x^* - x)$. This leads to an equation where the coefficients and powers of $(x^* - x)$ are equated on both sides. Simplifying the equation gives us two separate equations, one for the coefficients and another for the powers of $(x^* - x)$.

The coefficients' equation is:

The powers' equation is:
$$p - 3 = 5 p - 5.$$

Solving this system of equations provides the values of $\alpha$ and $p$. 
A valid solution is identified if $\alpha$ and $p$ are both nonzero. 
In this case, the solution for $\alpha$ and $p$ is found to be:
$$\alpha = - \sqrt{2} \cdot \sqrt[4]{3}, \quad p = \frac{1}{2}.$$

The solution in the small $x$ regime can be approximated using a Taylor series up to the third order. Plugging in the provided initial conditions, the Taylor series is:
$$y = x^{3} \cdot \left(\frac{1}{6} - \frac{1}{6 x^{2}}\right) + 1.5 x^{2} + x.$$ 

To find the solution in the large $x$ regime, the method of dominant balance can be used. The dominant balance is given by $$\frac{d^{3}}{d x^{3}} y = \left(\frac{d}{d x} y\right)^{5}.$$

A power law ansatz can be used to approximate the solution at the divergence point. The ansatz has the form 
$$y = \alpha (x^* - x)^p,$$

After substituting the derivatives, the equation is reorganized to collect terms with respect to $(x^* - x)$. This leads to an equation where the coefficients and powers of $(x^* - x)$ are equated on both sides. Simplifying the equation gives us two separate equations, one for the coefficients and another for the powers of $(x^* - x)$.

The solution in the small $x$ regime can be approximated using a Taylor series up to the third order. Plugging in the provided initial conditions, the Taylor series is:

A power law ansatz can be used to approximate the solution at the divergence point. The ansatz has the form 
$$y = \alpha (x^* - x)^p,$$

In this case, the solution for $\alpha$ and $p$ is found to be:

The solution in the small $x$ regime can be approximated using a Taylor series up to the third order. Plugging in the provided initial conditions, the Taylor series is:
$$y = \frac{5 x^{3}}{18} + 0.5 x^{2} + x + 1.$$ 

To find the solution in the large $x$ regime, the method of dominant balance can be used. The dominant balance is given by $$\frac{d^{3}}{d x^{3}} y = \left(\frac{d}{d x} y\right)^{5}.$$

A power law ansatz can be used to approximate the solution at the divergence point. The ansatz has the form 
$$y = \alpha (x^* - x)^p,$$

After substituting the derivatives, the equation is reorganized to collect terms with respect to $(x^* - x)$. This leads to an equation where the coefficients and powers of $(x^* - x)$ are equated on both sides.

In this case, the solution for $\alpha$ and $p$ is found to be:

"Consider the following third-order ordinary differential equation $$y''' = x + \frac{y}{\tan{\left(x \right)} + 3} + y'^{5} + \frac{y''}{\tan{\left(x \right)} + 1}$$

Find analytical expressions that approximate the solution of $y(x)$ in the small and large $x$ regimes.

The solution in the small $x$ regime can be approximated using a Taylor series up to the third order. Plugging in the provided initial conditions, the Taylor series is:
$$y = x^{3} \cdot \left(\frac{1}{6} + \frac{1}{6 \left(\tan{\left(x \right)} + 3\right)} + \frac{1}{2 \left(\tan{\left(x \right)} + 1\right)}\right) + 1.5 x^{2} + x + 1.$$ 

To find the solution in the large $x$ regime, the method of dominant balance can be used. The dominant balance is given by $$\frac{d^{3}}{d x^{3}} y = \left(\frac{d}{d x} y\right)^{5}.$$

A power law ansatz can be used to approximate the solution at the divergence point. The ansatz has the form 
$$y = \alpha (x^* - x)^p,$$ 
where $x^*$ is the divergence point and can be determined through numerical code. Plugging in the ansatz and solving for the terms yields 
$$- \alpha p \left(0.441039603960396 - x\right)^{p - 3} \left(p - 2\right) \left(p - 1\right) = - \alpha^{5} p^{5} \left(0.441039603960396 - x\right)^{5 p - 5}$$

After substituting the derivatives, the equation is reorganized to collect terms with respect to $(x^* - x)$. This leads to an equation where the coefficients and powers of $(x^* - x)$ are equated on both sides. Simplifying the equation gives us two separate equations, one for the coefficients and another for the powers of $(x^* - x)$.

The coefficients' equation is:
$$- \alpha p \left(p - 2\right) \left(p - 1\right) = - \alpha^{5} p^{5}.$$

The powers' equation is:
$$p - 3 = 5 p - 5.$$

Solving this system of equations provides the values of $\alpha$ and $p$. 
A valid solution is identified if $\alpha$ and $p$ are both nonzero. 
In this case, the solution for $\alpha$ and $p$ is found to be:
$$\alpha = - \sqrt{2} \cdot \sqrt[4]{3}, \quad p = \frac{1}{2}.$$

The ansatz is now $$y' = - \sqrt{2} \cdot \sqrt[4]{3}(0.441039603960396-x)^{\frac{1}{2}},$$ but to account for the initial conditions, a constant, $c=a-y'(0)$, is calculated and added to the ansatz.
Thus, an analytical solution that approximates the solution at large $x$ is given by

The solution in the small $x$ regime can be approximated using a Taylor series up to the third order. Plugging in the provided initial conditions, the Taylor series is:
$$y = x^{3} \cdot \left(\frac{167}{60} + \frac{1}{6 \left(\tan{\left(x \right)} + 2\right)}\right) + 0.5 x^{2} + 2 x + 1.$$ 

To find the solution in the large $x$ regime, the method of dominant balance can be used. The dominant balance is given by $$\frac{d^{3}}{d x^{3}} y = \left(\frac{d}{d x} y\right)^{4}.$$

A power law ansatz can be used to approximate the solution at the divergence point. The ansatz has the form 
$$y = \alpha (x^* - x)^p,$$ 
where $x^*$ is the divergence point and can be determined through numerical code. Plugging in the ansatz and solving for the terms yields 
$$- \alpha p \left(0.441039603960396 - x\right)^{p - 3} \left(p - 2\right) \left(p - 1\right) = \alpha^{4} p^{4} \left(0.441039603960396 - x\right)^{4 p - 4}$$

After substituting the derivatives, the equation is reorganized to collect terms with respect to $(x^* - x)$. This leads to an equation where the coefficients and powers of $(x^* - x)$ are equated on both sides. Simplifying the equation gives us two separate equations, one for the coefficients and another for the powers of $(x^* - x)$.

The coefficients' equation is:
$$- \alpha p \left(p - 2\right) \left(p - 1\right) = \alpha^{4} p^{4}.$$

The powers' equation is:
$$p - 3 = 4 p - 4.$$

Solving this system of equations provides the values of $\alpha$ and $p$. 
A valid solution is identified if $\alpha$ and $p$ are both nonzero. 
In this case, the solution for $\alpha$ and $p$ is found to be:
$$\alpha = - \sqrt[3]{30}, \quad p = \frac{1}{3}.$$

The ansatz is now $$y' = - \sqrt[3]{30}(0.441039603960396-x)^{\frac{1}{3}},$$ but to account for the initial conditions, a constant, $c=a-y'(0)$, is calculated and added to the ansatz.

The solution in the small $x$ regime can be approximated using a Taylor series up to the third order. Plugging in the provided initial conditions, the Taylor series is:
$$y = x^{3} \cdot \left(\frac{2}{3} + \frac{1}{6 \left(\tan{\left(x \right)} + 4\right)} + \frac{1}{2 \left(\sin{\left(x \right)} + 5\right)}\right) + 1.5 x^{2} + 3 x + 1.$$ 

To find the solution in the large $x$ regime, the method of dominant balance can be used. The dominant balance is given by $$\frac{d^{3}}{d x^{3}} y = \left(\frac{d}{d x} y\right)^{2}.$$

A power law ansatz can be used to approximate the solution at the divergence point. The ansatz has the form 
$$y = \alpha (x^* - x)^p,$$

After substituting the derivatives, the equation is reorganized to collect terms with respect to $(x^* - x)$. This leads to an equation where the coefficients and powers of $(x^* - x)$ are equated on both sides. Simplifying the equation gives us two separate equations, one for the coefficients and another for the powers of $(x^* - x)$.

The solution in the small $x$ regime can be approximated using a Taylor series up to the third order. Plugging in the provided initial conditions, the Taylor series is:

A power law ansatz can be used to approximate the solution at the divergence point. The ansatz has the form 
$$y = \alpha (x^* - x)^p,$$

The solution in the small $x$ regime can be approximated using a Taylor series up to the third order. Plugging in the provided initial conditions, the Taylor series is:

A power law ansatz can be used to approximate the solution at the divergence point. The ansatz has the form 
$$y = \alpha (x^* - x)^p,$$

The solution in the small $x$ regime can be approximated using a Taylor series up to the third order. Plugging in the provided initial conditions, the Taylor series is:
$$y = x^{3} \cdot \left(\frac{77}{6} - \frac{1}{6 x \left(x + 3\right)}\right) + 0.5 x^{2} + 3 x.$$ 

To find the solution in the large $x$ regime, the method of dominant balance can be used. The dominant balance is given by $$\frac{d^{3}}{d x^{3}} y = \left(\frac{d}{d x} y\right)^{4}.$$

A power law ansatz can be used to approximate the solution at the divergence point. The ansatz has the form 
$$y = \alpha (x^* - x)^p,$$ 
where $x^*$ is the divergence point and can be determined through numerical code. Plugging in the ansatz and solving for the terms yields 
$$- \alpha p \left(0.30102700270027 - x\right)^{p - 3} \left(p - 2\right) \left(p - 1\right) = \alpha^{4} p^{4} \left(0.30102700270027 - x\right)^{4 p - 4}$$

After substituting the derivatives, the equation is reorganized to collect terms with respect to $(x^* - x)$. This leads to an equation where the coefficients and powers of $(x^* - x)$ are equated on both sides. Simplifying the equation gives us two separate equations, one for the coefficients and another for the powers of $(x^* - x)$.

The coefficients' equation is:
$$- \alpha p \left(p - 2\right) \left(p - 1\right) = \alpha^{4} p^{4}.$$

The powers' equation is:
$$p - 3 = 4 p - 4.$$

Solving this system of equations provides the values of $\alpha$ and $p$. 
A valid solution is identified if $\alpha$ and $p$ are both nonzero. 
In this case, the solution for $\alpha$ and $p$ is found to be:
$$\alpha = - \sqrt[3]{30}, \quad p = \frac{1}{3}.$$

The ansatz is now $$y' = - \sqrt[3]{30}(0.30102700270027-x)^{\frac{1}{3}},$$ but to account for the initial conditions, a constant, $c=a-y'(0)$, is calculated and added to the ansatz.
Thus, an analytical solution that approximates the solution at large $x$ is given by
$$y = - \sqrt[3]{30}(0.30102700270027-x)^{\frac{1}{3}} + 2.08.$$


Therefore, the full solution is given by

A power law ansatz can be used to approximate the solution at the divergence point. The ansatz has the form 
$$y = \alpha (x^* - x)^p,$$ 
where $x^*$ is the divergence point and can be determined through numerical code. Plugging in the ansatz and solving for the terms yields 
$$- \alpha p \left(1.111099909991 - x\right)^{p - 3} \left(p - 2\right) \left(p - 1\right) = - \alpha^{5} p^{5} \left(1.111099909991 - x\right)^{5 p - 5}$$

After substituting the derivatives, the equation is reorganized to collect terms with respect to $(x^* - x)$. This leads to an equation where the coefficients and powers of $(x^* - x)$ are equated on both sides. Simplifying the equation gives us two separate equations, one for the coefficients and another for the powers of $(x^* - x)$.

The coefficients' equation is:
$$- \alpha p \left(p - 2\right) \left(p - 1\right) = - \alpha^{5} p^{5}.$$

The powers' equation is:
$$p - 3 = 5 p - 5.$$

Solving this system of equations provides the values of $\alpha$ and $p$. 
A valid solution is identified if $\alpha$ and $p$ are both nonzero. 
In this case, the solution for $\alpha$ and $p$ is found to be:
$$\alpha = - \sqrt{2} \cdot \sqrt[4]{3}, \quad p = \frac{1}{2}.$$

The ansatz is now $$y' = - \sqrt{2} \cdot \sqrt[4]{3}(1.111099909991-x)^{\frac{1}{2}},$$ but to account for the initial conditions, a constant, $c=a-y'(0)$, is calculated and added to the ansatz.
Thus, an analytical solution that approximates the solution at large $x$ is given by
$$y = - \sqrt{2} \cdot \sqrt[4]{3}(1.111099909991-x)^{\frac{1}{2}} + 4.96.$$

The solution in the small $x$ regime can be approximated using a Taylor series up to the third order. Plugging in the provided initial conditions, the Taylor series is:
$$y = x^{3} \cdot \left(\frac{40}{3} + \frac{1}{3 \left(\cos{\left(x \right)} + 1\right)} + \frac{1}{2 \left(\sin{\left(x \right)} + 3\right)}\right) + 1.5 x^{2} + 3 x + 2.$$ 

To find the solution in the large $x$ regime, the method of dominant balance can be used. The dominant balance is given by $$\frac{d^{3}}{d x^{3}} y = \left(\frac{d}{d x} y\right)^{4}.$$

A power law ansatz can be used to approximate the solution at the divergence point. The ansatz has the form 
$$y = \alpha (x^* - x)^p,$$ 
where $x^*$ is the divergence point and can be determined through numerical code. Plugging in the ansatz and solving for the terms yields 
$$- \alpha p \left(0.241021602160216 - x\right)^{p - 3} \left(p - 2\right) \left(p - 1\right) = \alpha^{4} p^{4} \left(0.241021602160216 - x\right)^{4 p - 4}$$

After substituting the derivatives, the equation is reorganized to collect terms with respect to $(x^* - x)$. This leads to an equation where the coefficients and powers of $(x^* - x)$ are equated on both sides. Simplifying the equation gives us two separate equations, one for the coefficients and another for the powers of $(x^* - x)$.

The coefficients' equation is:
$$- \alpha p \left(p - 2\right) \left(p - 1\right) = \alpha^{4} p^{4}.$$

The powers' equation is:
$$p - 3 = 4 p - 4.$$

Solving this system of equations provides the values of $\alpha$ and $p$. 
A valid solution is identified if $\alpha$ and $p$ are both nonzero. 
In this case, the solution for $\alpha$ and $p$ is found to be:
$$\alpha = - \sqrt[3]{30}, \quad p = \frac{1}{3}.$$

The ansatz is now $$y' = - \sqrt[3]{30}(0.241021602160216-x)^{\frac{1}{3}},$$ but to account for the initial conditions, a constant, $c=a-y'(0)$, is calculated and added to the ansatz.
Thus, an analytical solution that approximates the solution at large $x$ is given by
$$y = - \sqrt[3]{30}(0.241021602160216-x)^{\frac{1}{3}} + 3.93.$$


Therefore, the full solution is given by 
$$\boxed{y = x^{3} \cdot \left(\frac{40}{3} + \frac{1}{3 \left(\cos{\left(x \right)} + 1\right)} + \frac{1}{2 \left(\sin{\left(x \right)} + 3\right)}\right) + 1.5 x^{2} + 3 x + 2, y = - \sqrt[3]{30}(0.24 - x)^{\frac{1}{3}}+3.93}$$

To find the solution in the large $x$ regime, the method of dominant balance can be used. The dominant balance is given by $$\frac{d^{3}}{d x^{3}} y = \left(\frac{d}{d x} y\right)^{5}.$$

A power law ansatz can be used to approximate the solution at the divergence point. The ansatz has the form 
$$y = \alpha (x^* - x)^p,$$ 
where $x^*$ is the divergence point and can be determined through numerical code. Plugging in the ansatz and solving for the terms yields 
$$- \alpha p \left(0.241021602160216 - x\right)^{p - 3} \left(p - 2\right) \left(p - 1\right) = - \alpha^{5} p^{5} \left(0.241021602160216 - x\right)^{5 p - 5}$$

After substituting the derivatives, the equation is reorganized to collect terms with respect to $(x^* - x)$. This leads to an equation where the coefficients and powers of $(x^* - x)$ are equated on both sides. Simplifying the equation gives us two separate equations, one for the coefficients and another for the powers of $(x^* - x)$.

The coefficients' equation is:
$$- \alpha p \left(p - 2\right) \left(p - 1\right) = - \alpha^{5} p^{5}.$$

The powers' equation is:
$$p - 3 = 5 p - 5.$$

Solving this system of equations provides the values of $\alpha$ and $p$. 
A valid solution is identified if $\alpha$ and $p$ are both nonzero. 
In this case, the solution for $\alpha$ and $p$ is found to be:
$$\alpha = - \sqrt{2} \cdot \sqrt[4]{3}, \quad p = \frac{1}{2}.$$

The ansatz is now $$y' = - \sqrt{2} \cdot \sqrt[4]{3}(0.241021602160216-x)^{\frac{1}{2}},$$ but to account for the initial conditions, a constant, $c=a-y'(0)$, is calculated and added to the ansatz.

The solution in the small $x$ regime can be approximated using a Taylor series up to the third order. Plugging in the provided initial conditions, the Taylor series is:

To find the solution in the large $x$ regime, the method of dominant balance can be used. The dominant balance is given by $$\frac{d^{3}}{d x^{3}} y = \left(\frac{d}{d x} y\right)^{4}.$$

A power law ansatz can be used to approximate the solution at the divergence point. The ansatz has the form 
$$y = \alpha (x^* - x)^p,$$ 
where $x^*$ is the divergence point and can be determined through numerical code. Plugging in the ansatz and solving for the terms yields

After substituting the derivatives, the equation is reorganized to collect terms with respect to $(x^* - x)$. This leads to an equation where the coefficients and powers of $(x^* - x)$ are equated on both sides. Simplifying the equation gives us two separate equations, one for the coefficients and another for the powers of $(x^* - x)$.

Solving this system of equations provides the values of $\alpha$ and $p$. 
A valid solution is identified if $\alpha$ and $p$ are both nonzero. 
In this case, the solution for $\alpha$ and $p$ is found to be:

Find analytical expressions that approximate the solution of $y(x)$ in the small and large $x$ regimes.

The solution in the small $x$ regime can be approximated using a Taylor series up to the third order. Plugging in the provided initial conditions, the Taylor series is:
$$y = x^{3} \cdot \left(\frac{67}{24} + \frac{1}{2 \left(\cos{\left(x \right)} + 3\right)}\right) + 1.5 x^{2} + 2 x + 1.$$ 

To find the solution in the large $x$ regime, the method of dominant balance can be used. The dominant balance is given by $$\frac{d^{3}}{d x^{3}} y = \left(\frac{d}{d x} y\right)^{4}.$$

A power law ansatz can be used to approximate the solution at the divergence point. The ansatz has the form 
$$y = \alpha (x^* - x)^p,$$ 
where $x^*$ is the divergence point and can be determined through numerical code. Plugging in the ansatz and solving for the terms yields 
$$- \alpha p \left(0.381034203420342 - x\right)^{p - 3} \left(p - 2\right) \left(p - 1\right) = \alpha^{4} p^{4} \left(0.381034203420342 - x\right)^{4 p - 4}$$

After substituting the derivatives, the equation is reorganized to collect terms with respect to $(x^* - x)$. This leads to an equation where the coefficients and powers of $(x^* - x)$ are equated on both sides. Simplifying the equation gives us two separate equations, one for the coefficients and another for the powers of $(x^* - x)$.

The coefficients' equation is:
$$- \alpha p \left(p - 2\right) \left(p - 1\right) = \alpha^{4} p^{4}.$$

The powers' equation is:
$$p - 3 = 4 p - 4.$$

Solving this system of equations provides the values of $\alpha$ and $p$. 
A valid solution is identified if $\alpha$ and $p$ are both nonzero. 
In this case, the solution for $\alpha$ and $p$ is found to be:
$$\alpha = - \sqrt[3]{30}, \quad p = \frac{1}{3}.$$

The ansatz is now $$y' = - \sqrt[3]{30}(0.381034203420342-x)^{\frac{1}{3}},$$ but to account for the initial conditions, a constant, $c=a-y'(0)$, is calculated and added to the ansatz.

To find the solution in the large $x$ regime, the method of dominant balance can be used. The dominant balance is given by $$\frac{d^{3}}{d x^{3}} y = \left(\frac{d}{d x} y\right)^{5}.$$

A power law ansatz can be used to approximate the solution at the divergence point. The ansatz has the form 
$$y = \alpha (x^* - x)^p,$$ 
where $x^*$ is the divergence point and can be determined through numerical code. Plugging in the ansatz and solving for the terms yields 
$$- \alpha p \left(0.121010801080108 - x\right)^{p - 3} \left(p - 2\right) \left(p - 1\right) = - \alpha^{5} p^{5} \left(0.121010801080108 - x\right)^{5 p - 5}$$

After substituting the derivatives, the equation is reorganized to collect terms with respect to $(x^* - x)$. This leads to an equation where the coefficients and powers of $(x^* - x)$ are equated on both sides. Simplifying the equation gives us two separate equations, one for the coefficients and another for the powers of $(x^* - x)$.

The coefficients' equation is:
$$- \alpha p \left(p - 2\right) \left(p - 1\right) = - \alpha^{5} p^{5}.$$

The powers' equation is:
$$p - 3 = 5 p - 5.$$

Solving this system of equations provides the values of $\alpha$ and $p$. 
A valid solution is identified if $\alpha$ and $p$ are both nonzero. 
In this case, the solution for $\alpha$ and $p$ is found to be:
$$\alpha = - \sqrt{2} \cdot \sqrt[4]{3}, \quad p = \frac{1}{2}.$$

The ansatz is now $$y' = - \sqrt{2} \cdot \sqrt[4]{3}(0.121010801080108-x)^{\frac{1}{2}},$$ but to account for the initial conditions, a constant, $c=a-y'(0)$, is calculated and added to the ansatz.
Thus, an analytical solution that approximates the solution at large $x$ is given by
$$y = - \sqrt{2} \cdot \sqrt[4]{3}(0.121010801080108-x)^{\frac{1}{2}} + 1.64.$$


Therefore, the full solution is given by 
$$\boxed{y = x^{3} \cdot \left(\frac{119}{3} + \frac{1}{6 \left(\sin{\left(x \right)} + 4\right)} + \frac{1}{2 \left(\sin{\left(x \right)} + 3\right)}\right) + 1.5 x^{2} + 3 x + 1, y = - \sqrt{2} \cdot \sqrt[4]{3}(0.12 - x)^{\frac{1}{2}}+1.64}$$

So, to simplify the integral, we will expand the integrand around this minimum. \par However, it is impossible to compute the minimum of $f(t)$ within these bounds analytically. We, therefore, find the minimum numerically with the dual annealing algorithm. Using a few iterations of dual annealing, we find that the minimum of $f(t)$ occurs at $t_0 = [-0.75]$. \par Since the integral is dominated by the value of the integrand near -0.75, we Taylor expand the integrand around this point: \begin{equation} I(x) =  \int_{a}^{b} (g(-0.75) + (t+0.75)g'(-0.75)+...) e^{- x (f(-0.75) + (t+0.75) f'(-0.75) + \frac{(t+0.75)^2}{2} f''(-0.75) +...)} \end{equation}But $f'(-0.75) = 0$ by definition, so we can remove this term from the exponent. We can then approximate \begin{equation} I(x) \approx \int_{a}^{b} g(-0.75) e^{- x (f(-0.75) + \frac{(t+0.75)^2}{2} f''(-0.75))} \, dt, \end{equation} \par which equals \par \begin{equation} g(-0.75) e^{- x f(-0.75)} \int_{a}^{b} e^{- x (\frac{(t+0.75)^2}{2} f''(-0.75))} \, dt. \end{equation} \par We perform the change of variables $u = \sqrt{x \frac{|f''(-0.75)|}{2}}(t+0.75)$, rewriting the integral as \begin{equation} g(-0.75) e^{- x f(-0.75)} \int_{\sqrt{x \frac{|f''(-0.75)|}{2}} (a+0.75)}^{\sqrt{x \frac{|f''(-0.75)|}{2}} (b+0.75)} \sqrt{\frac{2}{x |f''(-0.75)|}} e^{-u^2} \, du. \end{equation} \par Since we are interested in a solution for $I(x)$ as $x \to \infty$, we can simplify the integral by approximating the bounds as \begin{equation} g(-0.75) e^{- x f(-0.75)} \sqrt{\frac{2}{x |f''(-0.75)|} } \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} e^{-u^2} \, du. \end{equation} \par Solving this integral and evaluating, we find that \par \begin{equation} \boxed{I(x) \approx - 0.08 \sqrt{\pi} \sqrt{\frac{1}{x}} e^{1.60 x}}. \end{equation}",integral,math_expression,,,,22.62116930469024,-140825000000000.0,-135630000000000.0,\boxed{I(x) \approx - 0.08 \sqrt{\pi} \sqrt{\frac{1}{x}} e^{1.60 x}},,,

    The integral is of the form $I(\epsilon) = \int_0^{80} \frac{1}{\epsilon + P(x)} dx$ where $P(x)$ is a polynomial. Thus, its value can be estimated as the product between a height and a width.

    The integral is of the form $I(\epsilon) = \int_0^{53} \frac{1}{\epsilon + P(x)} dx$ where $P(x)$ is a polynomial. Thus, its value can be estimated as the product between a height and a width.
    Since the integrand is maximized at $x = 0$, the height can be set to $\frac{1}{\epsilon}$.

    For small $\epsilon$,
    we define the width as the point where the integrand becomes half of its maximum height.
    This corresponds to solving for $x$ given $P(x) = \epsilon$.
    Applying dominant balance, considering the term in $P(x)$ with the smallest degree, the width is approximated as $ \left( \frac{1}{5.0*\epsilon} \right)^{1/6.0} $.
    Therefore, the analytical approximation of the integral for small $\epsilon$ is $\boxed{I(\epsilon) = \frac{0.91}{\epsilon^{0.94}}}$.

    For an intermediate regime where $\epsilon$ is large,
    we also define the width based on the term with the largest degree.
    The width is approximated as \( \left( \frac{1}{8.0*\epsilon} \right)^{1/18.0} \).
    Therefore, the analytical approximation of the integral for large $\epsilon$ is $\boxed{I(\epsilon) = \frac{0.71}{\epsilon^{0.83}}}$.

    The integral is of the form $I(\epsilon) = \int_0^{42} \frac{1}{\epsilon + P(x)} dx$ where $P(x)$ is a polynomial. Thus, its value can be estimated as the product between a height and a width.
    Since the integrand is maximized at $x = 0$, the height can be set to $\frac{1}{\epsilon}$.

    For small $\epsilon$,
    we define the width as the point where the integrand becomes half of its maximum height.
    This corresponds to solving for $x$ given $P(x) = \epsilon$.
    Applying dominant balance, considering the term in $P(x)$ with the smallest degree, the width is approximated as $ \left( \frac{1}{8.0*\epsilon} \right)^{1/13.0} $.
    Therefore, the analytical approximation of the integral for small $\epsilon$ is $\boxed{I(\epsilon) = \frac{0.85}{\epsilon^{0.92}}}$.

    The integral is of the form $I(\epsilon) = \int_0^{18} \frac{1}{\epsilon + P(x)} dx$ where $P(x)$ is a polynomial. Thus, its value can be estimated as the product between a height and a width.
    Since the integrand is maximized at $x = 0$, the height can be set to $\frac{1}{\epsilon}$.

    For small $\epsilon$,
    we define the width as the point where the integrand becomes half of its maximum height.
    This corresponds to solving for $x$ given $P(x) = \epsilon$.
    Applying dominant balance, considering the term in $P(x)$ with the smallest degree, the width is approximated as $ \left( \frac{1}{4.0*\epsilon} \right)^{1/6.0} $.
    Therefore, the analytical approximation of the integral for small $\epsilon$ is $\boxed{I(\epsilon) = \frac{0.92}{\epsilon^{0.94}}}$.

    For an intermediate regime where $\epsilon$ is large,
    we also define the width based on the term with the largest degree.
    The width is approximated as \( \left( \frac{1}{2.0*\epsilon} \right)^{1/16.0} \).
    Therefore, the analytical approximation of the integral for large $\epsilon$ is $\boxed{I(\epsilon) = \frac{0.89}{\epsilon^{0.83}}}$.

Consider the integral $I(\epsilon) = \int_0^{53.00} \frac{1}{\epsilon + 9.0 x^{6.0} + 9.0 x^{7.0} + 9.0 x^{14.0}} dx$. Develop analytical formulas that approximate $I(\epsilon)$ for different regimes of $\epsilon$.,"
    The integral is of the form $I(\epsilon) = \int_0^{53} \frac{1}{\epsilon + P(x)} dx$ where $P(x)$ is a polynomial. Thus, its value can be estimated as the product between a height and a width.
    Since the integrand is maximized at $x = 0$, the height can be set to $\frac{1}{\epsilon}$.

    For small $\epsilon$,
    we define the width as the point where the integrand becomes half of its maximum height.
    This corresponds to solving for $x$ given $P(x) = \epsilon$.
    Applying dominant balance, considering the term in $P(x)$ with the smallest degree, the width is approximated as $ \left( \frac{1}{9.0*\epsilon} \right)^{1/6.0} $.
    Therefore, the analytical approximation of the integral for small $\epsilon$ is $\boxed{I(\epsilon) = \frac{0.85}{\epsilon^{0.93}}}$.

    For an intermediate regime where $\epsilon$ is large,
    we also define the width based on the term with the largest degree.
    The width is approximated as \( \left( \frac{1}{9.0*\epsilon} \right)^{1/14.0} \).
    Therefore, the analytical approximation of the integral for large $\epsilon$ is $\boxed{I(\epsilon) = \frac{0.69}{\epsilon^{0.83}}}$.

    If the width of the integral exceeds the range of integration, we consider one more regime for very large $\epsilon$.
    The width is then just the range of integration, so in this regime, the integral can be approximated as $\frac{L}{\epsilon}$.
    Therefore, the analytical approximation of the integral for very large $\epsilon$ is $\boxed{I(\epsilon) = \frac{53}{\epsilon}}$.

    Altogether, the solutions at small, large, and very large $\epsilon$ are $\boxed{\frac{0.85}{\epsilon^{0.93}}, \frac{0.69}{\epsilon^{0.83}}, \frac{53}{\epsilon}}$.

    The integral is of the form $I(\epsilon) = \int_0^{16} \frac{1}{\epsilon + P(x)} dx$ where $P(x)$ is a polynomial. Thus, its value can be estimated as the product between a height and a width.
