In this case, the integral can be evaluated as:\\n\\n$$I(\\\\epsilon) \\\\approx \\\\int_0^{5.00} \\\\frac{1}{x^{13.0}} dx = \\\\int_0^{5.00} x^{-13.0} dx = \\\\frac{[x^{-12.0}]}{(-12.0)} \\\\Bigg|_0^{5.00}.$$\\n\\nHowever, we need to be careful when evaluating this integral because the lower limit is 0, and the integrand is not defined at $x=0$. We can use L'Hôpital's rule to evaluate the limit:\\n\\n$$\\\\lim_{x \\\\to 0} \\\\frac{1}{x^{13.0}} = \\\\lim_{x \\\\to 0} \\\\frac{0}{-13.0x^{12.0}} = \\\\lim_{x \\\\to 0} \\\\frac{1}{-13.0x^{12.0}} = \\\\infty.$$\\n\\nSince the limit is infinite, we cannot use this approximation for small $\\\\epsilon$.\\n\\n3. **Intermediate $\\\\epsilon$**: For intermediate $\\\\epsilon$, we can use a series expansion to approximate the integrand. We can expand the term $\\\\epsilon + 1.0 x^{13.0}$ in a Taylor series around $\\\\epsilon = 0$:\\n\\n$$\\\\epsilon + 1.0 x^{13.0} \\\\approx 1.0 x^{13.0} + \\\\epsilon + \\\\frac{1}{2!} \\\\left( \\\\frac{d^2}{d\\\\epsilon^2} (1.0 x^{13.0}) \\\\right) \\\\epsilon^2 + \\\\frac{1}{3!} \\\\left( \\\\frac{d^3}{d\\\\epsilon^3} (1.0 x^{13.0}) \\\\right) \\\\epsilon^3 + \\\\cdots.$$\\n\\nSince the derivative of $1.0 x^{13.0}$ with respect to $\\\\epsilon$ is 0, the series expansion simplifies to:\\n\\n$$\\\\epsilon + 1.0 x^{13.0} \\\\approx 1.0 x^{13.0} + \\\\epsilon.$$\\n\\nSubstituting this expansion into the integrand, we get:\\n\\n$$\\\\frac{1}{\\\\epsilon + 1.0 x^{13.0}} \\\\approx \\\\frac{1}{1.0 x^{13.0} + \\\\epsilon}.$$\\n\\nWe can use this approximation to evaluate the integral:\\n\\n$$I(\\\\epsilon) \\\\approx \\\\int_0^{5.00} \\\\frac{1}{1.0 x^{13.0} + \\\\epsilon} dx.$$\\n\\nTo solve this integral, we can use the substitution $u = 1.0 x^{13.0} + \\\\epsilon$, which gives:\\n\\n$$du = 13.0 x^{12.0} dx.$$\\n\\nSubstituting this into the integral, we get:\\n\\n$$I(\\\\epsilon) \\\\approx \\\\frac{1}{13.0} \\\\int_{\\\\epsilon}^{1.0 x^{13.0} + \\\\epsilon}_{\\\\epsilon} \\\\frac{1}{u} du = \\\\frac{1}{13.0} [\\\\ln(u)]_{\\\\epsilon}^{1.0 x^{13.0} + \\\\epsilon}.$$\\n\\nEvaluating the limits, we get:\\n\\n$$I(\\\\epsilon) \\\\approx \\\\frac{1}{13.0} \\\\left[ \\\\ln(1.0 x^{13.0} + \\\\epsilon) - \\\\ln(\\\\epsilon) \\\\right].$$\\n\\nNow, we can use the properties of logarithms to simplify the expression:\\n\\n$$I(\\\\epsilon) \\\\approx \\\\frac{1}{13.0} \\\\ln\\\\left( \\\\frac{1.0 x^{13.0} + \\\\epsilon}{\\\\epsilon} \\\\right).$$\\n\\nWe can further simplify the expression by using the fact that $x^{13.0} \\\\ll \\\\epsilon$ for $x \\\\ll \\\\epsilon^{1/13}$:\\n\\n$$I(\\\\epsilon) \\\\approx \\\\frac{1}{13.0} \\\\ln\\\\left( \\\\frac{x^{13.0}}{\\\\epsilon^{13.0}} \\\\right) \\\\approx \\\\frac{1}{13.0} \\\\ln\\\\left( \\\\frac{x^{13.0}}{\\\\epsilon^{13.0}} \\\\right).$$\\n\\nWe can now use the approximation $\\\\ln(1 + x) \\\\approx x$ for small $x$:\\n\\n$$I(\\\\epsilon) \\\\approx \\\\frac{1}{13.0} \\\\ln\\\\left( \\\\frac{x^{13.0}}{\\\\epsilon^{13.0}} \\\\right) \\\\approx \\\\frac{1}{13.0} \\\\left( \\\\frac{x^{13.0}}{\\\\epsilon^{13.0}} - 1 \\\\right).$$\\n\\nEvaluating the integral, we get:\\n\\n$$I(\\\\epsilon) \\\\approx \\\\frac{1}{13.0} \\\\left[ \\\\frac{x^{14.0}}{14.0 \\\\epsilon^{13.0}} \\\\right]_0^{5.00} = \\\\frac{5^{14.0}}{182.0 \\\\epsilon^{13.0}}.$$\\n\\nTherefore, the analytical formulas that approximate $I(\\\\epsilon)$ for different regimes of $\\\\epsilon$ are:\\n\\n*   For large $\\\\epsilon$:\\n\\n$$I(\\\\epsilon) \\\\approx \\\\frac{5.00}{\\\\epsilon}.$$\\n\\n*   For intermediate $\\\\epsilon$:\\n\\n$$I(\\\\epsilon) \\\\approx \\\\frac{5^{14.0}}{182.0 \\\\epsilon^{13.0}}.$$\\n\\n*   For small $\\\\epsilon$, we cannot use this approximation.\\n\\nWe can combine these formulas into a single expression that is valid for all $\\\\epsilon$:\\n\\n$$I(\\\\epsilon) = \\\\begin{cases} \\\\frac{5.00}{\\\\epsilon} & \\\\text{for large } \\\\epsilon \\\\\\\\ \\\\frac{5^{14.0}}{182.0 \\\\epsilon^{13.0}} & \\\\text{for intermediate } \\\\epsilon \\\\end{cases}.$$\\n\\nThe final answer is \\\\boxed{\\\\begin{cases} \\\\frac{5.00}{\\\\epsilon} & \\\\text{for large } \\\\epsilon \\\\\\\\ \\\\frac{5^{14.0}}{182.0 \\\\epsilon^{13.0}} & \\\\text{for intermediate } \\\\epsilon \\\\end{cases}}.\")}"
